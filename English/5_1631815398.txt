DIRECTOR’S REVIEW

 

The Postgraduate Institute of Science (PGIS), University of Peradeniya, established in 1996 by an
ordinance from the Ministry of Higher Education, is an institution for postgraduate education and
research in scientific disciplines in Sri Lanka. It has successfully expanded over the years to conduct
several M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph.D. programs as well as postgraduate diploma and certificate courses under
11 Boards of Study with the participation of a large number of postgraduate students from different
universities in Sri Lanka and abroad. The principal objective of the Postgraduate Institute of Science is to
promote and provide postgraduate instruction, training and research in various scientific specialties,

enhancing the graduate academic experience.

Being situated in the premises of University of Peradeniya, it provides an ideal environment for
intellectual activities particularly in interdisciplinary areas. PGIS has the opportunity of obtaining
services from academic staff members with postgraduate qualifications from some of the best universities
in the world. The members of the teaching panels are drawn from nine faculties of the University of
Peradeniya, as well as from other universities and institutes. The excellent research facilities available at
the Faculty of Science and other Faculties of the University of Peradeniya and research institutions in the
country are used to provide research training to students. PGIS conduct in-service training programmes,
short courses and workshops. The Institute also offers consultancy services to local industry and
public/private sector institutions. The PGIS indeed plays a unique and leading role among the other
institutes of Sri Lanka. The institute continues to develop leaders in the fields of science and provides for
the betterment of society through its research, focusing on solutions to national and international issues.

The long-term goal of the Institute is to become a leading science and technology university.

The PGIS caters to the growing demand for trained Science and Technology manpower facilitating
through appropriately resourceful, university-wide activities and strategic collaborations with
professional bodies, commercial organizations, research organizations, government bodies, other
universities and public and private sector organizations in Sri Lanka. The quality of the postgraduate
degree programmes has been maintained at a high standard in order to attract a large number of

postgraduate students locally as well from other countries in the region, during the past decade. Over this


period, student enrollment increased at a greater rate at PGIS. A significant number of postgraduates are
providing their expertise to the national development while being associated in both private and public
sectors. The PGIS has become the leading degree awarding institute in Sri Lanka for postgraduate
research and education in scientific disciplines. During the past 23 years the PGIS has awarded, through
the University of Peradeniya, more than 2500 postgraduate degrees (Ph.D., M.Phil. and M.Sc.) in different
disciplines of science and more than 17,000 have participated in workshops, conferences and short-term

training courses/programmes.

In keeping with the vision and mission of the PGIS, activities have been planned in the corporate plan for
the next 3 years. During this period, we will focus on building education with Asian countries,
strengthening long-term connections and relationships with other research institutes of Sri Lanka and
creating international opportunities and connections for our students. By providing modern learning
prospects, we will prepare our students for multiple future careers, while teaching them to think
critically, excel in their chosen disciplines and grasp the importance of continuing to learn over the course
of their lives. We need our students to be responsible citizens and leaders who value knowledge,
creativity and national awareness. Our strengths in developing future postgraduate programmes,
increasing student intake and promoting innovative research have been taken into account in preparing
the corporate plan. A student database for efficient administration and for future planning was initiated
recently at the PGIS. The PGIS is planning to expand its activities with the opening of the new building and

looking forward for a productive future ahead.

BRIEF INTRODUCTION

 

The Postgraduate Institute of Science (PGIS) is a National Institute attached to the University of
Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. Presently, approximately 2400 students are registered at the PGIS. It was
established in 1996 by an ordinance from the Ministry of Higher Education in order to promote science
education and research & development (R&D) in scientific disciplines in Sri Lanka. The principal objective
of the Postgraduate Institute of Science is to promote and provide postgraduate instruction, training and
research in various scientific specialties thus enhancing the graduate academic experience.

The PGIS offers Masters, M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph.D. degree programmes as well as postgraduate diploma and
certificate courses to cater to the demand in both the public and private sectors in the nation. The M.Sc,
M.Phil. and Ph.D. programmes require completion of a research project while the other programmes
require completion of course work only. Provisions are available to conduct research work at either in the
University System or at a relevant research institution in Sri Lanka. Many research programmes of the
PGIS are conducted with the collaboration of the Faculty of Science, University of Peradeniya and other
institutes of the country. The student population includes local and foreign graduates from different
disciplines of science. In addition, structured and tailor-made training programmes, such as short courses
and workshops, are also conducted frequently. GIS and Applications and Scientific Writing are two
popular short-term programmes conducted by the PGIS. The programmes of the PGIS are conducted
through 11 Boards of Study, covering all science disciplines including Science Education. The members of
teaching panels are drawn from the nine Faculties of the University of Peradeniya, as well as from other

universities, institutes and industries. The institute also offers consultancy services to local industry and


public/private sector institutions. Sandwich programmes and collaborative research projects have also
been launched with international institutions and state organizations. Under the ERASMUS scholarship
programme, PGIS students have received scholarships to continue their studies abroad. The PGIS conduct
research conferences and symposia including the annual PGIS Research Congress, with the academic
collaboration of both local and foreign participants.

The PGIS provides efficient services to its stakeholders through its dedicated and well-trained staff, and
as a result, its efforts towards internationalization have become stronger during the last few years. The
PGIS hopes to achieve its vision in the future by becoming one of the best postgraduate institutes in

scientific disciplines and research in Asia.

1.3 RESEARCH CONGRESS

 

 

 

 

The PGIS Research Congress (PGIS RESCON) was initiated to promote and strengthen the research
culture of the Postgraduate Institute of Science (PGIS), University of Peradeniya, and in turn to contribute
to the expansion of research activities of the country. After five extremely successful events from 2014 to
2018, this year its sixth Research Congress 'RESCON - 2019" was successfully held on 11th of October
2019. The event was organized jointly by the PGIS and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research.
As a premier event in the academic calendar of scientists in the country, the PGIS RESCON 2019 provided
the opportunity for researchers to disseminate their findings, and update their knowledge on the cutting-

edge of scientific research in Sri Lanka.

Over three hundred and fifty participants registered at the congress and the event was inaugurated
ceremonially by the Chief Guest, His Excellency Mr. Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the High Commissioner of
India to Sri Lanka on Friday, 11th October 2019 at the Postgraduate Institute of Science. Mr. Dhirendra
Singh, the Assistant High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka also graced the occasion. The Guest of Honor
for the occasion was Prof. S. H. P. P. Karunaratne (Deputy Vice-Chancellor, University of Peradeniya)
representing Prof. Upul B. Dissanayake, the Vice Chancellor, University of Peradeniya. Mr. HM B C Herath
(Additional Secretary, Ministry of Science, Technology and Research) representing the Secretary, Ministry
of Science, Technology and Research also graced the occasion. Professor Alan Lyons of the College of
Staten Island and Graduate Center of CUNY, USA delivered the keynote address at the inauguration. The
inauguration ceremony was followed by Technical Sessions, and the Congress Dinner was held at Amaya

Hills Hotel, Kandy on the same day.

Technical sessions of the PGIS Research Congress were held on the same day at the Postgraduate Institute
of Science premises. PGIS RESCON 2019 provided an excellent platform for researchers from many
disciplines and promoted the interaction among postgraduate students and researchers while providing
an opportunity for them to develop relationships with scientists having diverse background. A total of
145 abstracts were selected following a peer review process. These presentations were categorized into
five broad themes: Earth and Environmental Science; Information & Communication Technology,

Mathematics and Statistics; Life Sciences; Physical Sciences; and Science Education. Of the selected 145

1.6 DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN AND PHYSICAL RESOURCES

1.6.1 Human Resources

Several members visited overseas universities and laboratories for special training programmes,
workshops, conferences and collaborative research activities. Meanwhile, one academic staff position, an

academic support staff position and two non-academic vacancies were filled in 2019.

 

 

 

 

 

During the year both faculty as well as non-academic staff of PGIS rendered valuable service to the achievement

of institutional goals.

instrument booking and data management

e Purchasing sophisticated major instruments/equipment to develop PGIS as a high-quality well-
equipped research center

eo Development of research material storage facility for laboratories to avoid delays in research
activities and projects

eo Mechanisms to promote degree programmes and other PGIS events (Social media, PGIS YouTube
channel, media team and PGIS ambassadors to promote events among foreign institutes)

e Setting up career guidance and counseling mechanisms through workshops and possibly a center
or office

eo Development of existing laboratories to promote good research practices and research culture

e Implementation of new industrial outreach activities such as PGIS startup programme and R & D
support for industries

eo Awarding PGIS research grants

oe Formulation and implementation of new degree programmes to meet with the current demand

e Introducing new conferences, workshops and awareness programmes with the latest topics in
the world

e Attraction and registration of more international students to improve university ranking.

The Director

Post Graduate Institute of Science

Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements and Other Legal and Regulatory

Requirements of the Post Graduate Institute of Science for the year ended 31 December 2019 in

terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018

1.1

The audit of the financial statements of the Post Graduate Institute of Science for the year
ended 31 December 2019 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31
December 2019 and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in
equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under
my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the
Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with provisions of the
National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018 and the Finance Act, No.38 of 1971. My report to
Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled
in due course.

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified
Opinion section of my report, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair
view of the financial position of the Institute as at 31 December 2019, and of its financial
performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka

Public Sector Accounting Standards.

Basis for Qualified Opinion

The Institute had not identified a correct accounting policy relating to account for the course fees

and an internal control system related thereto had not been established.

Outstanding Distress loan balance and Computer loan balance of Rs. 112,988 of an officer had

been stated under the current assets during the year under review.

Despite the uncertainty of the recovery of Rs. 50,338,160 misappropriated during the period from
2008 to 2016, it had been stated under the non-current assets in the financial statements and as

such, the assets of the Institute were not properly shown.

The Institute had understated the receipt of research grants of Rs. 138,594 and payment of

research grants of Rs. 140,717 in the financial statements during the year under review.

I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My
responsibilities, under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I believe
that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for

my qualified opinion.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the
Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and
fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and for such internal
control as management determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial

statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related

to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management


14

either intends to liquidate the Institute or to cease operations, or has no realistic

alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Institute’s financial

reporting process.

As per Sub-section 16(1) of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018, the Institute is
required to maintain proper books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and
liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to be prepared of the

Institute.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sri Lanka
Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions

of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, I exercise

professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:

e Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,

intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.


e Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of

expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Institute’s internal control.

e Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

e Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern basis
of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 1 conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify
my opinion. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease to

continue as a going concern.

e Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the

underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters,
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I

identify during my audit.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

Although the Institute had paid Rs.8,519,579 for 139 visiting lecturers for 11 postgraduate
courses conducted in the year 2019, a system of evaluation from the students to ascertain whether

the services of those lecturers were received properly had not been followed.

There was no formal arrangement in place to appoint an examination evaluation panel for the
evaluation of the answer sheets of the examinations conducted by the Institute and to securely

store the examined answer sheets.

Compared to the approved staff and the actual staff in the year 2017, there were 15 vacancies in
11 posts and 07 excesses in 03 posts. Although it has been more than two years since the approval
of the cadre, the management had not paid attention for filling the existing vacancies immediately
and obtaining approval for excess posts as per the requirements or transferring those officers to

other institutions.

The Institute maintains 24 fixed deposits in a one bank and management had not focused on
reducing the amount of deposit certificates to suit the needs of the Institute and minimizing the

possibility of committing financial irregularities.

Since the Institute had not exercised due care and diligence in calling for open bids for awarding
the cleaning contract for the year 2019, the Rs.49,335 spent on the first newspaper advertisement
had become uneconomic transaction due to publishing newspaper advertisements on two

occasions by the Institute.

Although 04 vehicles had been attached to the Institute by the end of the year 2019, due to the
employment of only one driver, 03 vehicles owned by the Institute remained underutilized and it

had been a severe impediment to the daily activities of the Institute.

Although Rs. 10,000 had been paid to the Sri Lanka Transport Board for checking the fuel
consumption of 04 vehicles owned by the Institute during the year under review, by the end of
2019, the drivers had recorded the fuel consumption in the daily running charts at different rates

than the rate approved by that inspection.

The closing balance of 03 research projects which had not been executed during the year under
review amounted to Rs. 227,714 by the end of the year and no action had been taken to settle the

balances of completed researches or spend them on research activities.

No action had been taken to properly inventory 23 instruments worth Rs. 562,027 purchased

under research grants in the year 2019.

Although Rs. 813,649 had been spent on installing 20 security cameras in 2017 and 2019, the

storage time of those cameras was as short as less 21 days.

Although the Institute had appointed 06 officers including the Store Keeper for the Board of
Survey of the year 2018 and submitted the survey reports to the Audit, it was not confirmed that

the survey was conducted according to the inventory documents.

During the audit test check conducted regarding the short term course conducted by the Institute
in the year 2019, it was observed that the students who completed 03 courses had been awarded
the relevant certificates for those courses without being recovered the outstanding course fees of

Rs. 640,000 of those students.

The Postgraduate Institute of Science had not incurred any expenses from the Fund established
for granting facilities for researches and scholarships during the year under review and there was

a balance of Rs. 8,038,458 in the Fund at the end of the year.

No action had been taken to recover vehicle rental income of Rs. 98,962 which had elapsed for a

period exceeding 05 months to 08 months as at the end of the year under review.

Out of the receivable course fee income of Rs.15,428,800 identified in the financial statements

(d)

As specified in the Notes 1.4.1 (b) of the financial statements, only the course income
pertaining to the current year has been shown in the Statement of Operating Performance
under the Course Fee Revenue Head in accordance with the accepted accounting
principles. Accordingly, the adjustment in respect of the receipts for the coming year
received in the current year (Differed Income) and the adjustment required for the
income not received by the end of the current year in relation to the current year have
been made to the course income. However, action will be taken to reveal relevant

accounting policy clearly in the financial statements in the future.

The distress loan balance of Rs. 99,988 and the computer loan balance of Rs.13,000
pointed out by the Audit is applicable to Mahesh Iddawala, the Senior Assistant Bursar
who has been interdicted at present. Since his university provident fund has not yet been

released, action will be taken to recover it in the future.

As indicated in the Note 1.2.6 in the financial report, the Attorney General's Department
is currently in the process of recovering Rs. 50,338,160 relating to the misappropriation.
All the proceedings related to filing cases in the court have been finalized by now. The
audit report submitted by the Forensic Audit Division of the Government Audit Division
has also pointed out with evidence that the accused former Bursar Mahesh Iddawala had
fraudulently obtained this amount. Further, steps are also being taken to recover that
amount from the People's Bank, which is also a party responsible for the financial loss
incurred by the Institute. Accordingly, as we have a reliable expectation of the possibility

of recovering this loss, it is correct to state the amount under a non-current asset.

The differences pointed out in the audit are accepted. Action will be taken to correct it in

the future.

Powers, Duties and Functions

(a)

@)

I)

The Postgraduate Institute of Science conducts specialized postgraduate courses in the
field of higher education. Further, it is found difficult to enroll students for the next

academic year if the courses are not completed on time.

The Postgraduate Institute of Science has only two full-time Senior Lecturers in the staff
and all academic affairs are conducted by experienced lecturers who specialize in the
relevant subject. There are a least number of specialist lecturers in Sri Lanka for many
subjects. In some subjects it is difficult to re-check the answer sheets as the courses have
to be completed on time and the experts on the subject matter are scarce. However, in
case of any problem, the re-checking of the answer sheets is done and we are always
ready to do so. However, special attention will be paid to the matters pointed out in the

audit in the future.

In releasing the results, we adopt more accurate and transparent process and confirm and
release the results in the following order. If any injustice has been caused to the students
in this process, it is also observed. It is then possible to re-check the answer sheets as

required.

The order followed in the release of the results is as follows.

1. After surveying the results, the head lecturer in charge of the relevant subject

observes them and grades the results.

2. The results are checked by the Coordinator of the relevant postgraduate program.


(b)

(IIT)

3. Re-checking and grading by the Board of Studies in the relevant stream
4. Issuing final results subject to the approval of the Director of the Institute

However, when an external lecturer is included, his / her first question paper will
be reviewed by an expert. Similarly, the reviewing and grading of the results is
done in a well-accepted manner and according to a standard. However, prompt
action will be taken to bring the required documents under the purview of the
Postgraduate Institute of Science. All postgraduate courses in our institute have

been approved by the University Grants Commission.

We carry out the examination and approval of students' research dissertations according
to an internationally accepted methodology. Herein, those dissertations and reports are
subject to the supervision of three examiners relevant to the stream and the Chair of the
Board of Studies. A transparent procedure is adopted in the selection of the examiners.
This methodology has been approved by the Governing Body and is implemented in all

the universities in Sri Lanka.

The answer sheets relevant to the scoring procedure are prepared by the examiners.
Scoring cannot be carried out according to a specific procedure. Examiners perform a
statistical analysis of the students' marks and rank them accordingly. The scoring system
is determined based on the number of students, the manner in which the answers have
been given, and how the scores are allocated. Arrangements are being made to use
modern technology for this purpose. For all these activities, measures are being taken to

implement a special computer based modern system with transparency in the near future.

Two relevant forms were approved by the Council of the University of Peradeniya on
18.03.2019 to ascertain whether there is a dual relationship between the academic staff
and the students. The two forms, which have been modified to apply to the Postgraduate
Institute of Science, will be used from this year to determine whether there is a dual

relationship between academic staff and students.

Form 1 (to be filled by students)

 

Every time a new student (M.Sc./M.Phil. /Ph.D.) is enrolled, arrangements will be made
to obtain this form filled by her or him to the Postgraduate Institute of Science in the

future.


Form 2 (to be filled in by the Lecturers)

 

Arrangements will be made to obtain this form filled by the lecturers to the Postgraduate

Institute of Science.

3. Other Audit Observations

a.     Since 2016, the Postgraduate Institute of Science has initiated a system to obtain
students’ assessment to ensure whether the service of its lecturers is properly provided
for the postgraduate courses conducted by the Institute. Although the students’
assessments had been obtained from time to time by the Institute or by the respective
lecturers, it had not been systematically stored in our Institute. In the future, student
evaluation sheets with respect to the services of the respective lecturers will be obtained

through a formal system and stored at this institution.

b.          The respective Boards of Studies in each stream act as the Exam Evaluation Panel for the
examinations conducted by the Postgraduate Institute of Science. We have established 11

Boards of Studies for this purpose.

Subsequent to the evaluation of these Board of Studies, the relevant results should be

tabled again at the relevant Coordinating Committee Meeting before they are issued.

Although answer sheets have been currently stored securely with the lecturers (lecturers
have kept such answer sheets with them to show them in case of students’ problems), an
arrangement will be made to store all the answer sheets securely in this Institute in the
future. Answer sheets related to the visiting lecturers who are not working in the

University are kept with the Coordinator of the course.

Cc.       According to the approved cadre list for the year 2017 of the Postgraduate Institute of
Science, 02 out of 05 senior level posts (Senior Lecturer) have been filled and the
remaining 03 vacancies will be filled according to the requirement of the Institute.
Further, the vacancy for the post of Deputy Bursar/ Senior Bursar cannot be filled as the
relevant formal disciplinary inquiry has not been completed. Similarly, the vacancy for
the post of Deputy Registrar/Senior Registrar will be filled by the University Grants
Commission and the post of Assistant Registrar belongs to the permanent cadre (In

accordance with the provisions of the cadre list 2013, the University Grants Commission


appointed an Assistant Registrar to the post of Senior Assistant Registrar in the cadre in
the year 2016), but this post has not been filled as it does not belong to the approved
staff. Arrangements are being made to fill the vacancy of Technical Officer (Internal).
Necessary action was taken to recruit one person on the basis of transfer from the
primary grade posts to the post of driver and the relevant recommendations have been
forwarded to the University Grants Commission at present. Furthermore, the Department
of Management Services has already been informed by the University Grants
Commission that the Institute does not require the posts of Electrician and Office
Machinery Clerk. Arrangements are being made to fill the vacancy in the post of
Management Assistant (Shroff) on transfer basis. Further, recruitments to existing
positions in the Institute will be made in accordance with the recommendation of the

Board of Management, the requirement of the Institute and the amount of cost

The Department of Management Services has been informed about the changes in the
cadre list of our Institute by the letters dated 11.07.2018, 12.02.2019, 19.12.2019 and
09.02.2020 through the University Grants Commission. Necessary arrangements are

being made to correct the Cadre list of the Institute.

The matter pointed out in the audit is currently being dealt with.

As informed at the Board of Management meeting of the Postgraduate Institute of
Science held in September 2018, the new building of the Institute was to be put into use
by the end of October 2018 in terms of the contract agreement. Therefore, it was planned
to award the contract at the same time as applicable to all three buildings. Nevertheless,
the construction of the new building has not been completed as scheduled by October
2018. Objective to take steps to call for bids as applicable to all three buildings (Block A,
B, C) was to taking into account the administrative advantage of awarding the cleaning
service as a single contract and avoiding the financial disadvantage to the Postgraduate
Institute of Science in recruiting the cleaning service by re-publishing a newspaper
advertisement for the new building (Block C). Although all the procurement activities
have been carried out to commence new cleaning work on 01.11.2018 by opening the
building as announced at the Board of Management meeting, the Technical Committee
dated 31.10.2018 had to recommend for re-bidding as the construction of the new
building was further delayed. This is an unexpected situation. However, this has not

caused any financial disadvantage to the Institute.


Two drivers served in the Postgraduate Institute of Science and one of them retired on
04.12.2019. In order to fill the above vacancy, one driver was selected on the basis of
transfer from the interview held on 03.02.2020. The relevant recommendations were sent
to the University Grants Commission by the letter dated 29/07/2019 and the University
Grants Commission has, by letter dated 09/12/2019, informed that he had rejected the
appointment and canceled the relevant transfer. At that time, the Government had
informed to cancel all new recruitments. Accordingly, as per a request made to the
University Grants Commission, a driver was re-selected by conducting an interview on
03/02/2020 using the transfer applications submitted to us and relevant recommendations
have been forwarded to the University Grants Commission for necessary action. Due to
the current situation in the country, the selected drivers have not yet been referred to our
Institute.

The other driver of the institute has been attached to the duties of the Director of the
Institute and the drivers of the University of Peradeniya are brought to the Institute to
perform the daily duties as per the requirements of the institute. After the recruitment of
the new driver, he will be attached to the office duties as in previous years. Our bus is
used for field trips attended by large groups of students for the courses and workshops of
institute. Accordingly, there are times when the bus does not run in certain months. Field
trips are often arranged on weekends, and the application therefor should be submitted a
few days in advance. In those cases, the bus is driven by one of the two drivers working
in our Institute and a minor employee of the Institute as a driving assistant. Also, the old
car owned by the Institute is driven in very limited cases and the same procedure is
followed in those instances. In those cases, the remaining driver of the Institute will be
used to cover the duties of the office and the duties of the Director. As indicated above,
we obtain the services of two drivers for four vehicles to carry out the activities of this
Institute very efficiently and all the financial activities are carried out using the income
earned by the Postgraduate Institute of Science and the employees have been very

effectively attached to the affairs of the Institute.

Defects and other inspections of 04 vehicles belonging to the Institute are carried out by
an experienced Assistant Managing Engineer of the Sri Lanka Transport Board with the
approval of the Management Committee of the Institute and the fuel consumption test is
also carried out by him (Est: Code: Chapter xxvii- 7: 8). The charges on his behalf are

paid in accordance with the approval given by the Management Committee.


The bus is used to provide the necessary transport facilities for field trips and short
courses organized by the courses of the institute and as the bus transports a large number
of students under air conditioning conditions, and in some cases due to traffic congestion
and driving on small roads with very steep slopes (e.g. - Ambuluwawa) during these field

trips may have resulted in this situation.

Furthermore, as the official vehicle bearing the number CP CAE-0317 used by the
Director of the Postgraduate Institute of Science is used for the Director's daily official
trips and the number of his travelling on traffic congested roads has increased, this

variation may have occurred.

The van owned by the Institute was manufactured in 1996 and has been used extensively
for short trips since inception of the Institute (with minor repairs). As it is widely used
for short trips, the relevant fuel consumption test values of the van may have changed.
(Although requests have been made to the relevant divisions to obtain a van on the
requirement of the Institution, we have been informed by the Ministry of Higher
Education that the relevant activities have been temporarily suspended as per Circular

No: 05/2019 issued by the Department of National Budget).

The Car bearing No.301-6318 owned by the Institute is rarely used as the above van is
widely used for daily activities. Due to using it on short trips on requirements and during
less traffic congestions (e.g. used on several occasions to get to the Katunayake airport
on Sundays) this variation may have occurred. However, the drivers were informed to

rectify this situation and to state the reasons for the variations.

The Professors in charge of the relevant projects have been informed to expedite the
settlement of the grants of the research projects (Project No. 6142,6252,6259) on which
no transaction whatsoever had been carried out during the year 2019 as pointed out by

the audit.

The equipment purchased under research grants is included in a separate inventory
register. An inventory certificate is also obtained from the relevant researcher for that
purpose. A copy of the document containing the assets pointed out by the audit is also
submitted to the Audit. Since the Argan Gas Cylinder is not an asset, it has not been

included in the register.


Action will be taken to increase the capacity in the future and thereby increase the

number of days that data can be stored up to 90.

In addition to the officers of the Institute, Mr. Shanaka Rodrigo, Senior Assistant Bursar
of the University of Peradeniya acted as the Chairman of the Board of Surveys conducted
in 2018 and an officer of the Internal Audit Division was also involved as a member of it.
Further, the relevant survey report has been submitted to the Auditor General and a copy

is available in the Institute.

Arrangements are being made to recover the arrears and action will be taken not to issue

certificates to those who do not pay money in the future.

Arrangements are being made to utilize the balance of the Research Fund Account.

The balance of Rs. 45,171.87 exists under the overdue charges as pointed out by the audit i
transport facilities provided for the NIFS by our Institute. However, the Director of the NIFS infor
letter that the transport facilities had to be obtained to transport students of the Postgraduate In
Science and therefore to provide some relief. This matter was discussed at the 37th Moneta
Meeting held on 28.04.2020 and it was approved to recover the amount due from the Bench Fees
from the students of the Postgraduate Institute of Science in the future. The balance amount show

audit has also been recovered at present.

Due to unavoidable reasons including non-academic staff strike, the study could not be
completed within the expected time and it took longer than the time scheduled to start of
the academic activities of the second semester. As a result, the collection of course fees
was delayed. A large amount of arrears has been recovered by now. Course coordinators

are constantly informed to take action to recover arrears of course fees.
