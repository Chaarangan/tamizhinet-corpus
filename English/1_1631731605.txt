1.2. Research and Innovation Section

1.2.1. Introduction

Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) has been a core driver of the development process
to date and addresses emerging national, regional and global developmental challenges across
many sectors. In a knowledge-based society, Research & Development (R & D) and
innovation in new and emerging areas of technology (e.g. biotechnology, nanotechnology,
ICT, new and renewable energy) are critical for stimulating economic growth of countries. In
the context of sustainable development, the new and emerging technology areas are being
considered important for addressing many of our challenging technological, environmental
and economic problems. These technologies possess immense potential to offer cost-effective
and innovative solutions in critical areas of sustainable development such as climate change
through renewable energy and energy storage technologies, clean water, waste water
treatment, food safety, enhancing agricultural production, prevention of diseases and
affordable health care.

Although Sri Lanka has relatively very low investment on R & D, which is 0.1 percent of
GDP, Research and Innovation sector of the State Ministry of Skills Development,
Vocational Education, Research and Innovation plays a significant role in contribution to
National Development Goals through Research and Development, Innovations and
Inventions and Product Design Engineering. Recognizing this, Research and Innovation
sector is specially engaged in promoting demand driven research, innovation focused industry
-research tie-ups and creating enabling environment through financially and technically
supporting techno entrepreneurships. On the other hand, special focus is given on developing
and adapting emerging technologies such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, space
technologies, Robotics, artificial intelligence etc. Science popularization is being promoted
through various initiatives such as promotion of Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM education), development of technology based curriculum in
collaboration with relevant line Ministries.

3.9 Auditor General's Report

VTY/B/MSDVT/FA/2020

Accounting Officer
State Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational Education, Research and Innovation

June 22.2021

Concise Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the State
Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational Education, Research and Innovation
for the year ended 31st December 2020 in terms of Section 11(1) of the National
Audit Act, No 19 of 2018

1. Financial Statement

1.1 Opinion

The audit of financial statements of the State Ministry of Skills Development,
Vocational Education, Research and Innovation for the year ended 31st December
2020 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31st December 2020, and the
Statement of Financial Performance and the Cash flow Statement for the year then
ended was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in article 154(1)
of the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in

1.4

conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018. My Comments
and observations with regard to this financial statement, being forwarded to the State
Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational Education, Research and Innovation in
terms of section 11(1) of the National Audit Act No: 19 of 2018, appear in this report.
The Auditor General’s report due for submission in terms of section 10 of the
National Audit Act No:19 of 2018 read in conjunction with the article 154(6) of the
constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, will be tabled in
Parliament in due course.

In my opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the
financial position of the State Ministry of Skills Development, Vocational Education,
Research and Innovation as at 31st December 2020 and of its financial performance
and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the generally accepted
accounting principles.

Basis for Qualified Opinion

I conducted my Audit in accordance with the Sri Lanka Auditing Standards
(SLAuSs). My responsibilities, under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s Responsibilities Section of the report. I believe that the audit evidence I
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified opinion.

Responsibilities of the Chief Accounting Officer and Accounting Officers

The Accounting Officer is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
that give a true and fair view in accordance with the generally accepted accounting
principles and the provisions of the Section 38 of the National Audit Act No:19 of
2018, and to determine the internal control necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error. As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act No:19 of 2018, the Ministry is
required to maintain proper books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets
and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to be prepared of the
Ministry.

In terms of the provisions of the sub section 38(1)(c) of the National Audit Act, the
Chief Accounting Officer should provide assurance that an effective internal control
system has been prepared and is in effect and the effectiveness of the said system
should be reviewed from time to time in order to effect necessary changes for the
effective maintenance of the system.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the financial statements

My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sri
Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,

29


individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, I exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I
also,

eo Identify and assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations or the override of internal control.

e Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Ministry’s
internal control.

e Evaluate the structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentations.

e [Evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements, that it represents
the structure and the underlying transactions and events that made up the
content, in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicated with the Accounting Officer regarding, among other matters,
significant audit findings, including any deficiencies in internal control that I
identified during my audit.

(b)

Advance account balances

 

The following observations were made in the audit.
An outstanding loan balance of Rs.522,270 as at 31st December 2020 was observed

which had occurred due to officers vacating their posts and retiring with the
outstanding period ranging from 02 years to 20 years.

Entering into Liabilities and Commitments

 

(a)      Owing to noncompliance with the instructions stipulated by the Public
Accounts Circular n0.255/2017 dated 21st April 2017 and Financial Regulation
94(3) .the total of the expenditure exceeding net provisions amounted to a
total of Rs.584,400 following adjustments being made to liabilities relevant to
07 vote subjects and the remaining balance, at the end of the year.

(b) Even though all liabilities should be entered as per Public Accounts Circular

255/2017 liabilities to the value of Rs.189,770 had not been entered in the
register on liabilities for the year under review.

Noncompliance with rules and regulations

 

Instances where noncompliance with rules and regulations was observed in sample
audit inspections are as follows.

together with the original of the monthly summary on

had failed to comply with the said requirement.

Financial Regulations             Even though annual surveys had to be conducted on

756,757,and 1647 (b)                 vehicles and additional equipment of the Research and

had not been complied with.

Exceeding of Limits

Deposits older than 02 years to the value of Rs.301,312 relevant to the years 2017 and

Operational Review

 

Performance

 

(2)

(b)

(d)

Even though the Ministry has been tasked with the formulation and
implementation of strategies to increase the tendency to pursue vocational
education, the student participation in certain courses conducted by the
vocational training centres under the Ministry’s purview remained low due to
the lack of a proper programme to attract students. Accordingly, despite being
provided with adequate capacities and all necessary facilities to admit a higher
number of students it had failed to enroll a maximum number of students in
order to effectively and efficiently make use of such resources.

It was observed that student turnout for highly demanded fields in the job
market remains at a minimum level due to the students’ dislike for certain
courses, a significant percentage of students leaving courses and most students
preferring only several courses of high popularity.

Vocational guidance plays a prime role in eliminating unemployment among
youths in various areas of the island by directing them towards vocational and
technical studies through proper vocational guidance. With a view to
accomplishing this task, 259 Skills Development Assistants have been
attached to 331District Secretariats. However, it was revealed in the audit
inspection on performance that the said officers showed poor progress.

In order to provide high standard vocational training, an academic staff with
an adequate knowledge should be recruited and in order to improve their
teaching standards they should be made to participate in training programmes
as relevant to their subject fields, adequately. It was revealed that a shortage of
experienced instructors had been created by not complying to the above
requirement.

33


3.1.1

3.1.2

Delays in project implementation

(a) Even though it had been planned to initiate and finalize 14 projects with a total
value of Rs.(Mn)784.36, as per the progress report of the Research and
Innovation Division for the year under review, the progress of the said projects
ranged from 34% to 89% while it was observed in the audit that 11 of these
projects recorded a progress below 75%.

(b) The progress of the 02 projects ‘Social Innovation Lab’ being implemented at
a cost of Rs.(Mn.) 80, and the project ‘Improving Degraded Soil' being
implemented at a cost of Rs.(Mn) 70 which were initiated in January 2018 and
due for completion at the end of that year, stood at 70% and 64% respectively
at the end of the year under review.

(c)   Even though Rs. Mn.) 111 had been allocated for 03 projects to be
implemented under the Research and Innovation Division during the year
2020,the total allocation remained unspent as the projects did not get
underway.

(d)     Even though the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) had
offered loan facilities ,for the development of a new university with expanded
premises with a view to conducting courses of a high standard for the Ocean
University, the project had not started off even by the end of the year under
review , due to the inability of finding a suitable land for the purpose, from
2017 .

Projects which had not achieved any progress despite release of funds

The following observations are made.

Even though the Ministry had expended Rs.(Mn.)35 on the establishment of the
Social Innovation Lab as per the cabinet approval received on 12th September 2017,
on the Cabinet Memorandum submitted on 10" August 2017, adequate written
evidence and progress reports to support the expenses of the project had not been
submitted to the audit.

The Internal Audit Division of the Ministry had also pointed out that the said project
had failed to comply with the Sri Lanka Financial Regulations 620 and 621 which
stipulates that foreign funded projects should be recorded under the Department of
External Resources and the foreign aid should be recorded under annual budget
estimates.

Management of Assets

 

The following observations are made.

(a)

(b)

As per the reports of the survey on inventoried goods conducted in respect of
the year under review , it was observed that the Skills Development and
Vocational Education Division had 113 items in surplus and 85 items in
shortage while the Research and Innovation Division had 221 items in surplus
and 273 items in shortage and that this matter had not been handled in terms
of Financial Regulations 752(2).

Utilization of Vehicles

 

The following observations are made.

It was observed that 11 vehicles to the value of Rs.(Mn) 39.6 remain
underutilized and non- running within a period of less than a year.

Management Inefficiencies

 

(a)

(b)

A sum of Rs.3,443,100 had been provided under the Skills Development
Sectoral Project for pre-publicity and planning work relating to the
organizing of the Skills Day celebrations and even though 22 videos have
been made at a cost of Rs.1,705,000 , the expected outcome had not been met
due to the delay in their publicization.

The following observations were made with regard to the establishment of a
National Vocational Training Centre in the Hingurakgoda area under a loan
aid of 42.5(Mn) euros.

(1)     Even though preliminary work relating to the construction of a
National Vocational Training Centre consisting of 05 training schools
to conduct 20 courses with a dormitory to accommodate 450 students
with 14 rooms reserved for foreign tourists,120 official quarters for
employees and other infrastructure facilities, was commenced under
the Sri Lanka Vocational Training Authority in 2017,no inquiries were
made on the Authority’s need for such a facility.

(11)     By the letter dated 16% March 2017pertaining to this matter issued by
the Director General of the Department of National Planning which
addressed the Director General of the Department of External
Resources, the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational
Training was assigned this task with attention being paid to the
demand for vocational education in the Polonnaruwa district, increase
of expenses, issues relating to the academic and non- academic staff.
Further, by the cabinet decision dated 18%" September 2018 the

35


3.4

3.5

Secretary to the Ministry was assigned the task of conducting an
extensive feasibility study on the recommendations made by the
Minister of Finance and forwarding a report with comparisons being
made with other projects of similar nature.However,the Secretary to
the Ministry had entered into agreements for the said project with the
contracting institution on February 21st ,2019without the conduct of a
feasibility study and a study on the cost and the outcome, overriding
the cabinet decision.

(ii) As per the contractual agreement, an amount equal to 3% of the
average overall operational cost for the previous 4 years ,0f 226 centres
including 07 National Vocational Training Institutions functioning
under the Sri Lanka Vocational Training Authority, would have to be
spent on the proposed National Vocational Training Centre and it was
observed that these decisions were reached without due consideration
being paid to the outcomes compared with the costs incurred.

Uneconomic Transactions

 

Even though the Budget Circular n0.03/2020 of the Ministry of Finance, Economic
and Policy Development stipulated that owing to the COVID — 19 pandemic and
disasters which occurred as a result of adverse weather changes, expenses should be
borne only in respect of priority requirements which have already been implemented
and which needs to be further continued, for the duration from June to August
2020,with no new commitments being made pertaining to staff expenses, supplies
and services, action had been taken to plan a skills and inventions competition
(Touch Your Future) for students pursuing vocational training at provincial level to
coincide with the World Youth Skills Day falling on the 15% of July for which paper
advertisements were published at a cost of Rs.1,777,707. However,the said expenses
had become an uneconomic expenditure due to the competition not being conducted.
