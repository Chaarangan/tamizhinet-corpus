23.6.6 Constrains

Lack of capital allocation for providing infrastructure facilities for the staff
members.
Insufficient space to expand the Laboratory space in par with increase in both
internal students due to establishment of new faculties and external student
members.
The center is located in an extremely old building that is not suitable for the IT center

and the vital and expensive equipment it contains.

Annual Report & Accounts - 2019, Wayamba University of Sri Lanka


Since the building is beyond the point of repairing, it largely prevents the expansion
of proper service provisions and hinders the services provided by the staff members

and their safety and wellbeing.

23.6.7 Suggestions for Further Development

Since the current building is very old and not suitable for the purpose, a new
building is required for the ICT Center, Kuliyapitiya.

Increase the number of academic staff with the increase in student demand due to
establishment of new faculties.

As the ICT infrastructure is expanded in the Kuliyapitiya premises from only two
faculties to four, the on-time maintenance and services requires additional office
staff such as Technical Officers, System Developers, and Web Developers.
Workshops for outsiders.

Expand the laboratory area to compensate the increase in the internal and external
student intake.

Expand the wireless network.

Staff Training.

Training students for General ICT Certification Test.

Setting up a Student-Based company which undertakes external projects in
software development / computer networking and information systems
development.

Increase the services and knowledge areas offered to the internal as well as the

external students in keeping up with the demand.

23.6.8 Any other Relevant Information

As there are vast number of opportunities and demand for ICT knowledge and services, work

towards transforming the ICT center as an ICT Knowledge and Services Center for Wayamba

University of Sri Lanka as well as for the general public. The ICT center is one of the key points

for public engagement as well as providing an educational interface to the public. To enhance these

interfacing activities, it is highly recommended to reallocate the ICT center to a new building

facility to expand its services, community engagement as well as to protect its equipment.

value of the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of
factors that are determined on an actuanal basis using number

mortality rates. The rates used in determining the defined
retirement benefit obligations are given in Note 17. Any

Accelerating Higher Education Expansion and Development Operation
(AHEAD)

The development of the higher education sector is of central importance to enable Sri
Lanka to make the transition from a Lower-Middle Income Country (LMIC) to an
Upper Middle-Income Country (UMIC). Recognizing this, the Government of Sri
Lanka (GoSL) and the World Bank have agreed to support the higher education sector
through a Bank funded Accelerating Higher Education Expansion and Development
(AHEAD) operation. The AHEAD operation is organized in two components. The
first 1s a Program Component that supports the national Higher Education
Development Program. The second is a systems strengthening, capacity building and
technical assistance component that will assist GoSL to strengthen the higher
education sector and achieve the objectives of the AHEAD program component. This
second will also cover monitoring and evaluation, policy analyses, program
coordination and communication. The implementing agency is the Ministry of Higher
Education. There will be an Operations Monitoring and Support Team (OMST) which
will coordinate and support all AHEAD activities between the MHEH, UGC, and the
universities.

The AHEAD has three Results Areas (RA):

Results Area 1: Increasing Enrolment in Priority Disciplines for Economic
Development

Results Area 2: Improving the Quality of Higher Education

Results Area 3: Promoting Research, Development and Innovation.

Grants under RA2 and RA3 are awarded under competitive basis. The units of the
universities (faculties and departments, and research teams) got opportunity to submit
proposals. During the last several months, the OMST called proposals for such awards
and a update of the awards that the WUSL has received is given in the table.

The Operations Technical Secretariat (OTS) established by the university assists the
faculties, departments and other units in implementation of their subprojects,
particularly in handling financial and procurement activities and advising them in
timely implementation of their projects. The OTS is operated by a staff comprising
both fulltime staff and part time staff.

Vice Chancellor
Wayamba University of Sri Lanka

Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements and other Legal and Regulatory

Requirements of the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka for the year ended 31 December

2019 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No.19 of 2018

1.1

The audit of the financial statements of the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka for the year
ended 31 December 2019 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31
December 2019 and the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in equity
and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements,
including a summary of significant accounting policies, was carried out under my direction
in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act , No
19 of 2018 and Sub-section 107(5) of the Universities Act, No.16 of 1978. My report in

terms of Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in Parliament in due course.

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified
Opinion section of my report, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the
financial position of the University as at 31 December 2019, and its financial performance
and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector

Accounting Standards.


1.2

Basis for Qualified Opinion

(a) Since useful life of the non-current assets had not been reviewed annually in terms of
Paragraph 65 of the Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 07, assets costing
Rs.199,494,369 were further in use despite being fully depreciated. However, action in
terms of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standard 03, had not been taken to revise

the estimated error occurred.

(b) An income from electricity amounting to Rs.4,145,363 receivable from the contractors

by the end of the year under review had omitted from accounts.

(c) Even though the wire fence constructed at a cost of Rs.1,188,230 around the land where
the Medical Faculty was located, had been capitalized in the year under review, it had
destroyed by the end of the year. Nevertheless, no action had been taken to write off

the said value from accounts.

(d) The value of 05 construction contracts amounting to Rs.759,174,529 of which the works
were completed by the end of the year under review, had not been included in the
Buildings Account and shown under the work in progress. As such, the value of
buildings had been understated by the same amount while the depreciation of

Rs.71,489,616 from the date of using the buildings, had not been brought to accounts.

(e) Excess provision totalling Rs.4,957,735 had been made as accrued expenses for
providing cleaning service, security service and private labour services for the year

under review.

(f) A sum of Rs.329,259 payable for creditors of supplies pertaining to the year under

review had omitted from accounts.

I conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My
responsibilities, under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities

for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I believe that the audit


evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my qualified

opinion.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the
Financial Statements

 

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and
fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards for such
internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of

financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
University’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
management either intend to liquidate the University or to cease operations, or has no

realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the University’s financial

reporting process.

As per Sub-section 16(1) of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018, the University is
required to maintain proper books and records of all its income, expenditure, assets and
liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to be prepared of the

University.


14

Auditor’s Responsibility for Audit of Financial Statements

My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sri Lanka
Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of

users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, I exercise

professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:

°       Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions or the override of internal control.

.        Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose

of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control.

.         Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of

accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

.      Conclude on the appropriateness of the management’s use of the going concern
basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material

uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on


the University’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause

the University to cease to continue as a going concern.

.         Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the

underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during

my audit.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018 includes specific provisions for following

requirements.

Even though the wire fence constructed at a cost of Rs. 1,188,230 around the land
where the Medical Faculty was located, had been capitalized in the year under
review, it had destroyed by the end of the year. Nevertheless, no action had been

taken to write off the said value from accounts.

As the final bill for this Contract had been forwarded to be accounted as a bill
payable and the contract had been named as a completed project, the relevant
bill had been accounted as a contract bill payable and the project had been

capitalized.

The value of 05 construction contracts amounting to Rs.759,174,529 of which the
works were completed by the end of the year under review, had not been included
in the Buildings Account and shown under the work in progress. As such, the value
of buildings had been understated by the same amount while the depreciation of
Rs.71,489,616 from the date of using the buildings, had not been brought to

accounts.

I)   Planting of Grass and other improvement of the Play Ground -
Kuliyapitiya - Rs. 35,259,956.00

The Consultancy Firm has not yet released the final bill. Prior to issuing the final

bill, the Consultancy Firm obtains an agreement from the Contractor on the


measurements. As this agreement has not yet been obtained, the Consultancy
Firm has not yet submitted the final bill. Therefore, this value has been

accounted as ongoing work.

II)       Faculty Building Stage III - FLFN Rs. 169,326,037.00

The final bill of this project has not yet been submitted but only interim bills have

been submitted. Therefore, this value has been accounted as ongoing work.

III) Construction Work Proposed Faculty Building Stage III (Final) FAS
Rs. 350,734,069.00

Once some major shortcomings that have been identified are corrected and the
Contractor submits the final bill and related documents, it will be added as an

asset. Until such time, it is accounted as ongoing work.

IV) Construction of Faculty Building Stage III - FAPM - Makandura
Rs. 200,882,117.00

The Contractor has been informed to correct shortcomings identified by the
University. Once such shortcomings are corrected and the Contractor submits
the final bill and related documents, it will be added as an asset. Until such time,

it will be accounted as ongoing work

V)   Construction of an Overhead Water Tank 20,00 L Capacity at
Kuliyapitiya - Rs. 2,972,350.00

As the Contractor has not submitted the final bill, action will be taken this year to
issue a final notice, consider as no payment are due and with the approval of the
Finance Committee, to transfer the value as an asset. Until such time, it will be

accounted as ongoing work


(e)

As all these constructions had been incomplete works during the year under

review, depreciation has not been carried out.

Excess provision totaling Rs. 4,957,735 had been made as accrued expenses for
providing cleaning service, security service and private labour services for the year

under review.

Accrued Expenses for Janitorial Service

Out of the amount of Rs. 11,238,460.17 shown as accrued expenses for
Kuliyapitiya and Makandura Premises, after deductions made for violations of
agreement, recommendations of Heads of Divisions etc., the balance value of

Rs. 10,290,460.38 has been forwarded to the Finance Division for payment.

Out of the amount of Rs. 10,575,955.60 requested as accrued expenses for
Labuyaya Premises and units added from time to time to the Janitorial
Agreement of 2018/2019, vouchers to the value of Rs. 3,102,480.00 have been

forwarded to the Finance Division for payment.

As per the BOQ for Janitorial services of 2018/2019 and the engineer's
estimates, vouchers for around Rs. 4,048,112.00 are due to be forwarded for

payment.

The accrued expenses for the Final Accounts for 2019 were submitted by
considering the engineer’s estimate, BOQ and the receipts submitted by the
relevant institution.   However, when forwarding bills for payments,
considering violations of agreement and percentages of payment recommended
by the Heads of Divisions and the Public Health Inspector, relevant

deductions have been made.


Accordingly, a reduction can be expected in the amount that is paid to the
relevant institution than the amount of accrued expenses requested for the

year 2019.

Accrued Expenses for Security Service

Based on the information obtained from the General Administration Division
and the analysis of the details of payments of previous months an amount of
Rs. 8,290,947.00 has been accounted as accrued expenses. An amount of
Rs. 8.008,725.00 has been paid according to the monthly bills received by the
When making payments for the bills,

around Rs. 282,222.00 (3.4% of the accrued expenses) has been deducted as

Accrued Expenses for Private Labour Services

An amount of Rs. 1,349,161.00 had been accounted as accrued expenses for
private labour services up to 31.12.2019. However, due to the reduction of the
number of days of attendance of the assigned labourers and the reduction in
the number of hours of overtime, payment made had been less by an amount
of Rs. 302,149.00 than the value of the accrued expenses accounted. The

details are given below :

(f) A sum of Rs.329,259 payable for creditors of supplies pertaining to the year under

review had omitted from accounts.

Although all goods received prior to 31.12.2019 had been accounted as assets, the
details of assets pertaining to the 3 vouchers mentioned above had been received
by the Supplies Division in the year 2020. Therefore, it was not possible to
account them for the year 2019.

balances of Rs. 831,700 pertaining to 02 bank accounts as

per bank reconciliation statements.

Action is being taken to identify the unidentified credit balance of Rs. 831,700.

(i1)Financial Regulations         Action in terms of Financial Regulations had not been taken
396 (¢) and (d)                 regarding 7 cheques amounting to Rs. 47,315 issued but not

presented for payment for over 02 years.

This balance has been credited to the University income by Journal R 139.

(111)Financial Regulation         Action in terms of Financial Regulations had not been taken
770                         regarding 22 stock items valued at Rs. 961,792 which were

Out of the 22 items mentioned in the audit query, four items (Item Code 0204DI02,
0310PT07, 0208DMO02, 0323PT01) pertains to the Supplies Division. A Board of

3.        Other Audit Observations

(a) Even though the Wayamba University had secured 8139" and 8" places in the world
rankings and ranking of Sri Lankan Universities respectively in the year 2018 while
8358™ and 08™ places had been secured respectively in the year under review. As

such, the position of University had dropped according to the world rankings.

The number of Faculties, number of students, information on the research done
by the University, research conferences etc. help a university’s ranking. The
Wayamba University of Sri Lanka has established new Faculties but the number
of students in those Faculties is few. Therefore, other factors in relation to the
University Faculties have not yet developed. That too affects the drop in the

ranking. Further, in order to increase the world ranking of the university, the


Wayamba University of Sri Lanka had organized several research conferences
(national and international) in 2020. However, due to the situation in the
country during this year it has not been possible to conduct those conferences as
planned. Action is being taken to update the website constantly, thereby
increasing the position of the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka in the world

ranking.

(b) According to the Action Plan prepared for the year under review by the University,
progress of 02 Faculties had not been submitted even by 18 May 2020 while the
progress review of 3 Faculties presented had revealed that 21 objectives had not been

achieved.

All Faculties were informed in writing to send the progress of the actions taken
in relation to the Action Plan of 2019. Although the two Faculties had been
repeatedly requested for the progress, I have not received them. I shall take
action once again to inform the two Faculties and obtain the progress on the

activities.

It 1s expected to include those activities in the Action Plan 2019 that could not be
carried out in 2019 into the Action Plan for 2020 and take action on them in the
year 2020.

(c) It had been possible to recruit only a cadre of 19 per cent out of the approved cadre
for the Faculty of Medicine while the dropout rate of the Faculty of Technology had
been 6 per cent out of the students enrolled for the years 2017/2018.

Applications were called for the approved cadre for the Faculty of Medicine and
qualified persons have been recruited. Applications have been called again for
the Departments which do not have qualified persons, and action will be taken to

recruit suitable persons after holding selection interviews.

169

17 students from the 2015/2016 Batch who did not qualify for the 3d Year under the

University Grants Commission criteria relating to the technology stream, were

admitted to the 2nd Year.

Accordingly, although the number of students for the Academic Year 2017/2018

should be 483, the number of registered students (the current student number) is

450. 33 students had not attended academic programmes. Details are as follows :

Students who do not participate in the degree programme (Academic           08

Year 2016/2017)

 


11

Students who do not participate in the degree programme (Academic           16

Transferred to the University of Sri Jayewardenepura (Academic Year              01
2015/2016)

Accordingly, 5% of the students have not participated in the degree programme.

The Faculty has contacted the students over the telephone constantly. It had been
found that the students do not participate in the academic programmes as some
students have been discouraged due to not qualifying for the 3rd Year, some students

have opted to find employment and some opted to go for education abroad.

At present action is being taken to contact these identified students in writing.

(d) Even though a sum of Rs. 1,013,750 had been deposited in Pannala Divisional
Secretariat in the year 2013 for 8 lots of paddy lands in 711 perches of which the
assessment value amounted to Rs, 3,835,000 in the area of authority of the said
Divisional Secretariat, action had not been taken even by the end of the year under

review to vest the relevant paddy lands without delay.

After obtaining a valuation from the State Department of Valuation, an application
was submitted to the Ministry of Lands through the Ministry of Higher Education
for the acquisition of the 08 plots of land, under the Acquisition of Paddy Lands Act.
The consent of the farmers had also been obtained for the above action. The
concurrence of the Commissioner of Agrarian Development, Department of Agrarian
Development, too had been obtained for this acquisition. Further, under the Act
pertaining to acquisition of lands, an advance of Rs. 1,013,750.00 had been deposited
with the Secretary, Divisional Secretariat, Pannala by the Wayamba University, on

18.04.2013. The ability and authority to act at legal and institutional level for the


12

acquisition of these eight plots of land, rests with the Secretary, Divisional

Secretariat, Pannala.

(e) A loss had been sustained by the University Fund due to a payment of Rs. 45,834
made as interest owing to the delay in the settlement of electricity bills pertaining to

September 2019 by the Wayamba University.

Due to the administrative and non-academic staff strike during the period 10.09.2019 to
13.10.2019, the payment of the electricity bill for August 2019 was delayed and due to
this reason, an additional amount of Rs. 45,833.75 had been added to the electricity bill
for the month of October 2019, and this amount had to be paid.

Nevertheless, it is kindly informed that in future, action will be taken to make the

payments without delay even in times of trade union actions.

(f) Even though the Unit of External Degree and Applied Courses of the Wayamba
University was functioning from November 2018, the Self Finance Courses of the
University had not been absorbed under this Unit even by May 2020 while an
adequate staff had also not been attached for this Unit.

Fee-levying courses are being conducted by Faculties and Units of the University
and action is being taken to integrate these courses into the External Degree and
External Courses Unit of the University. The executive officer assigned to the
Unit is functioning in Acting capacity and works as the officer of another

division.

(g) Out of sum of Rs. 3,437,160 provided to the University by the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization for the project of “The assessment of water and

sediment quality and associated sea urchin of the gulf of Mannar coastline” in the


13

years 2014 and 2016, an amount of Rs. 2,266,439 had remained underutilized for a

period over 3 years without being utilized for the relevant project.

This project has been granted to Dr. Mrs.) J AD S S Jayakody of the Faculty of
Livestock, Fisheries & Nutrition, and Dr. Jayakody has informed that the first
phase of the project has been completed. However, as she has been released
from the University with immediate effect to serve as a Consultant by letter
dated 01.08.2019 of the Vice-Chancellor, the work on the second phase has been
suspended temporarily. Dr. Jayakody has informed that the project work will

be commenced in the year 2020.

(h) Since the information was not adequately maintained by the University, it was not

(1)

possible to reveal the information to Audit that whether the approval had been
received for the Research Reports submitted to Research Committee at the end of
research period by 08 Lecturers of the Faculty of Business Studies and Finance who
have obtained research allowances of Rs. 1,793,067 during the period from 2016 to
2019.

Action will be taken to inform the eight lecturers of the Faculty of Business
Studies & Finance mentioned in the query, to submit the terminal reports to the

Faculty Research Committee.

Action will also be taken to inform all academic staff members that those who
obtain research grants under new proposals should submit the relevant report
after completing the research to the Faculty Research Committee and obtain the

approval.

According to Paragraph 03(i) of the Higher Education Circular No: 1/ 2011 of 20

been paid to 07 lecturers of the Faculty of Business Studies and Finance in 12
instances during the period 2015-2019, for the research reports published in

accepted publications several years ago contrary to the said Circular.

As per paragraph 04 (iii) of the Circular No. 02/2014 dated 11.02.2014, research

necessary corrections after establishing at a research evaluation committee.

Action had not been taken to recover a sum of Rs. 50,781,258 recoverable from
seven lecturers who had proceeded abroad for higher studies and did not return

within the due period.

The present status of the lecturers who have violated the Bonds and

Agreements, indicated in the audit query, are given in Annexure 2.

(k) The instructions given to maintain the money received from Self Finance Courses

MD

under a Public Fund as per the Decision No. 10 of the Committee on Public

Enterprises held on 28 November 2017, had not been followed.

The Audit Committee, at its 63rd Meeting has decided that excess funds of
courses that are certified by the Directors to have been completed, be
transferred to the Programme Development Fund. Accordingly, the relevant

funds have been transferred to the Programme Development Fund.

A sum of Rs. 196,912 payable to the contractor as at 31 December 2019 for the
work of improving the canteen of the Faculty of Business Studies, had not been

brought to account.


15

Although this bill had been submitted in relation to the refurbishing the canteen
of the Faculty of Business Studies & Finance, by that time this contract had been
ended by the University. As the value in the bill could not be clearly confirmed it
had not been accounted for the year 2019.

(m)Out of the capital provision made by the Treasury and University Grants
Commission in the year under review and 03 preceding years, funds amounting to

Rs. 81,946,192 had not been utilized.

By 31.12.2019, there were Rs. 137.5 Mn. of contract creditors and Rs. 17.2 Mn. of
supplies creditors and the University had, at the end of the year, a capital fund
balance of Rs. 81,946,192.00 obtained to release bonds pertaining to the
creditors. As the University has paid Rs. 41.8 Mn. in January 2020 and Rs. 71.6
in February 2020 pertaining to the relevant bills out of the above, there has not

been any under utilization.

(n) Even though a Van of which the assessment value amounted to Rs. 500,000 had not
been run since the year 2014, a sum of Rs. 205,264 had been spent on the repair

work during that period.

The van bearing No. 54-1785 is due to be handed over after repairing with the
installation of an air conditioning machine, to form a mobile multi-media unit by
the Information Communication Technology Centre. Until the repairs are

effected the vehicle has been assigned for the use of the Maintenance Division.
