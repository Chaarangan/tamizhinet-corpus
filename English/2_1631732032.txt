1 2        CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019

Chairman's Review

During the Year,
CEB was able to successfully

complete the enormous Greater

Colombo Transmission &

Distribution and Loss Reduction

Project. That has enabled the

organization to be in a position

to serve the development
needs of the City of
Colombo and the
Port City.

The year under review represented an historic landmark for
the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as in November 2019 we
celebrated our Golden Jubilee — 50 years of producing and
delivering electricity to the nation.

From humble beginnings, the CEB today enjoys the
unique honour of providing access to power for 99.6%
of the population, a most commendable and noteworthy
achievement. That stirring half-century of unrelenting
progress marks the CEB as a vital national institution
dedicated to serving our country.

We are grateful to our pioneering colleagues who were
involved at the inception. Similarly, we express our gratitude
to those who subsequently took over the baton to continue
the good work. Collectively they laid the strong foundations
that allow us today to proudly fulfil the CEB’s mission of
maintaining an efficient, safe, and reliable system of electricity
supply across the country.

CEB is a state-owned enterprise established on November
1, 1969 by the Act No. 17 of 1969 as amended by Act Nos.
31 0f 1969, 29 of 1979, and 32 of 1988. Sri Lanka Electricity

 
  
   
  
 

Act No. 20 of 2009 (Amended) brought CEB under the
regulatory purview of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri
Lanka (PUCSL).

CEB is responsible for electricity generation, transmission
and its distribution nationwide. In this task itis ably supported
by four subsidiaries, namely: Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt)
Ltd (LECO), LTL Holdings Limited (LTL), Lanka Coal Company
(Pvt) Ltd and Sri Lanka Energies (Pvt) Ltd along with the Joint
Venture, Trincomalee Power Company Ltd and a number of
Independent Power Producers (IPP’S).

During the year under review, 108,315 households received
new electricity connections and 146,360 additional
consumer accounts were created. Electricity sales during the
year reached 14,611 GWh, a 3.7% increase compared to the
previous year. However, the hotel sector usage decreased
by 5.4%, reflecting the sector issues arising from the Easter
Sunday Attack. In the meantime, net generation reached
15,922 GWh, a 3.6% increase compared to the previous year.

CEB is responsible for 100% transmission of electrical energy
throughout the country and a major part of the distribution


Chairman's Review (Contd.)

(88.5%) along with the state-owned distribution company
LECO, of which CEB holds a majority share. In 2019 CEB was
responsible for 71% of Sri Lanka's power generation. The
balance was produced through a mix of thermal, hydro, solar
and wind-based generating plants owned and operated by
independent power producers.

It is also motivating to highlight that the capacity of roof top
solar connections soared by 75% compared to 2018. The
total stood at 217,263 kW atthe end of 2019, signifying CEB’s
strong commitment towards harnessing renewable energy.

The total revenue billed from electricity sales increased by
5.8% or Rs 13,379 Million during 2019 to Rs 242,950 Million
- the organization's highest-ever recorded sales revenue.

This 5.8% uplift was due solely to increase in electricity
demand as no tariff revision has been implemented
since 2014. Unlike normal commercial operations within
organizations, where increased sales contribute to enhanced
profitability, the opposite happens at CEB. That is due to the
prevailing generation mix, so that the subsidy increases,
and consequent losses are greater. Recognizing this
contradiction, the organization focused during the year onan
intensive communication campaign to educate consumers
on the responsible use of electricity and power.

That campaign was vital as 2019 brought severe drought,
marked by the second lowest rainfall for the first half of the
year since 1990. That in turn prompted exceptionally low
hydro inflow to major reservoirs. As a result, generation from
both major hydro and mini-hydro plants dropped to 4,794.5
GWh, a sharp 24.9% reduction compared to the previous
year. With reduced hydro generation CEB had to rely on
thermal generation. Total thermal power generation was 65%
as atthe end of the year, a 10.6% increase compared to 2018.

This change in the generation mix towards more expensive
thermal power, which was beyond the control of CEB,
contributed to widening the gap between the production
costs and selling price. That caused CEB to lose around
Rs 5.85 for every unit sold. These mounting losses had a
negative impact on CEB’s financial position.

Although PUCSL is required legally to authorize a cost-
reflective electricity tariff for CEB, such has not been the
case since 2014, while the Government required that
several classes of consumers be continuously provided with
subsidized electricity. As a result, CEB must sell electricity to
consumers ata price less than the average cost of production.
In addition, with no reimbursement of government-
mandated subsidy forthcoming during the year, CEB was
forced to borrow further, costing the organization in 2019 a
staggering Rs 22.5 Billion in finance costs.

It is critical to emphasize that, despite multiple attempts to
strike a reasonable balance between the cost of production
and the selling price, CEB was compelled to sell power at

CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019        1 3

a price well below the cost of production. Management
submitted multiple proposals to consider an at least Rs
1 (one) increase in tariff which would have resulted in an
incremental revenue of approximately Rs 14 Billion per year —
thus relieving even in small measure the State subsidy.

In that context, | believe it may be prudent to share an insight
to the prevailing tariff structure and its serious continued
negative impact on State resources.

The present domestic tariff structure, which starts at Rs
2.50 for the first 30 units of consumption accounts for
19%, of the total customers. This segment were afforded a
subsidy of Rs 18.29 per unit consumed, which translates to
Rs 3.312 Billion worth of electricity subsidy given annually
to 1,257,262 customers. This same principle continued for
every additional 30 blocks of units until it leveled off after 181
units of consumption to finally register a subsidy of Rs 48.623
Billion for 5,651,452 domestic users, representing 87% of
our customer base. The balance (13% of our consumers)
includes numerous categories, of which the biggest subsidy
is afforded to the industrial sector, totaling Rs 37.635 Billion
in 2019.

This disheartening gap between cost of production and
selling price would have been addressed somewhat in
2019 had the previously approved plans for generating
power at much lower cost been implemented without any
impediments and delays — in particular, the first of the several
300 MW LNG plants planned. With regret, it is noted that the
300 MW plant has not materialized for reasons beyond the
realm of CEB’s control.

Notwithstanding the above, in 2019 CEB aggressively
pursued the plan to get the much delayed and derailed
generation plants off the ground. The base was commenced
to establish the two LNG power plants at Kerawalapitiya, and
for the extension of the Norochcholai coal power plant at our
existing site. Also to upgrade the gas turbine plants with more
modern and efficient machinery at our site in Kelanitissa and
to facilitate the rapid expansion of solar and wind plants. The
sooner the more efficient power plants come into operation,
the sooner the State will be rewarded with reduced subsidy,
with a pathway created towards making CEB a very profitable
State entity. | sincerely urge all concerned to place a major
emphasis and urgent focus on implementing the planned
generation plans without any further delay as this is a material
pathway to reduced operating costs and profitability.

CEB handled Rs. 36 Billion worth of projects during the year
under review. The organization’s focus for renewable and
clean energy was high on the agenda and all projects in this
space were pursued aggressively. The 100 MW Mannar Wind
Power Project was navigated as scheduled to commence
operations in 2020. This is the largest wind project in the
country and CEB is proud to be the owner and operator of
this facility.

Chairman's Review (Contd.)

The final phase of the tunnel of Broadlands 35 MW Hydro
Power Project was completed, which will move towards
commercial operation by January 2021. The 30.5 MW hydro
project at Moragolla and the 120 MW Uma Oya Hydro Power
Project were provided with all resources to reach completion
within the planned periods. These renewable energy projects
will add 285.5 MW of incremental capacity to the grid and will
in the future make a significant positive contribution to the
cost of generation.

In addition CEB continued to expand the small scale
renewable energy producers’ network and awarded 18 PPAs
to 06 solar, 01 biomass and 11 mini hydro producers. The
contribution from these initiatives is estimated at 25 MW.
These sustained and focused efforts — together with over 70
small renewable plants for solar and hydro that were in the
pipeline for award with pending Power Purchase Agreements
(PPA) - are estimated to add a further 90 MW of clean energy
to the grid, thus ensuring our continued efforts for absorbing
the maximum amount of renewable energy.

In the year under review, CEB also expanded its footprint to
support the National efforts to reduce carbon emissions by
launching 5 new CEB-owned and operated electric vehicle
charging stations (EVCS) strategically placed throughout the
country.

The Green Power Development & Energy Efficiency
Improvement Investment Program (Tranche 2), National
Transmission & Distribution Network Development and
Efficiency Improvement Project and Clean Energy and
Network Efficiency Improvements Project were some major
transmission enhancement projects aimed at absorbing
increased quantities of renewable energy. Such projects
progressed towards completion in the year under review with
minimal interruptions.

During the year, CEB was able to successfully complete the
enormous Greater Colombo Transmission & Distribution and
Loss Reduction Project. With this introduction of the 220kV
underground transmission cable network to the system, the
Greater Colombo power network has doubled.

Consequently, that has enabled the organization to be in
a position to serve the development needs of the City of
Colombo and the Port City. The conclusion of this major
transmission project also heralds a new era in improved
quality and reliability of electricity supply to Colombo.

The successful completion during the year of the Smart
Metering Pilot Project (Tranche 1) marked another giant
innovative step by CEB towards managing a more cost
effective and efficient consumer service with resulting
productivity enhancements.

We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to our
funding agencies, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan
International Corporation Agency (JICA), and Industrial

& Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for their continued
financial support.

In order to realize the Honorable Minister’s vision of making
CEB a customer-driven organization and to negate any
attributes of a monopolistic position, a ground-breaking
project was developed and successfully launched in June
2019. The organization ceremoniously initiated a new
dimension to serving the customers even better by launching
the ‘CEBCare’ Mobile Application — one of the self-service
channels of ‘CEB Assists’, the enterprise utility software
solution for the public.

We are extremely proud that CEB’s engineers were able to
design, develop and launch this state-of-the-art mobile app
within the year. The application is available for download to
mobile devices via both Google Play and Apple's App Store
and available in all three languages. The launch of the app is
an important milestone in CEB’s journey towards providing
our 6.5 Million customer base with a superior service,
providing more awareness and ensuring transparency. The
CEB Care app was able to revolutionize the service offering of
CEB and enabled digital experience to consumers on availing
services - including a mechanism to lodge complaints,
power interruption notification, online bill payment facility
and review usage information. The CEBCare app also
provides customers with a unified contact center for the CEB
that operates by virtually connecting the island-wide CEB call
centers.

The CEB has always been conscious of its Corporate Social
Responsibilities and during the year many projects were
concluded across multiple disciplines such as medical, rural
employment generation, converting waste to energy, tree
planting for a cleaner environment, and children’s knowledge
enhancement.

In the medical sphere, approximately 850 staff members
donated 850 pints of blood to the Colombo Blood Bank. The
Blood Bank has commended the CEB with gratitude for this
significant contribution and has been recognized as one of
the major donors of blood during 2019. We salute every staff
member who participated in this life-giving project.

In rural employment, the commissioning of a 3 MW Dendro
Power Plant at Dehiaththakandiya opened up significant
employment opportunities. It is estimated that the 1 MW
Dendro plant provides approximately 1,000 jobs, which
involves growing and harnessing the raw material required
for the operation.

In the Waste to Energy area CEB, in partnership with the
Treasury, the respective Municipality, and an Independent
Power Producer, signed the power purchase agreement
of the second Waste to Energy plant. This will be located in
Rathmalana and will be utilized to convert 147,000 Metric
Tons of waste per annum to 70 GWh of energy.


Chairman's Review (Contd.)

On the journey to a cleaner environment, your staff planted
over 8000 trees island-wide during the year. Last but
not least, for our children we conducted an island-wide
Interschool Quiz competition in collaboration with SLBC with
the objective of educating the country’s youth on electrical
safety and energy management.

Notwithstanding the absence of the power plants as set out
in the generation plan, the financial constraints from the
lack of subsidy support (resulting in the increased cost of
borrowing), coupled with severe drought weather conditions
that necessitated the use of more expensive thermal power,
and no tariff increases during the year, CEB was able to
manage the operations within the budgeted levels thanks
to prudent financial and administrative disciplines. It did
this while still ensuring the continuity of all existing and
new projects. We believe that this achievement signals a
satisfactory year for CEB in 2019.

It is regrettable to note that with the present generation mix
in place, the organization's good health lies in the availability
of adequate rainfall. This is a serious anomaly and needs
to be addressed as a priority with the State’s commitment
towards the rapid unhindered roll-out of the CEB’s derailed
generation plans, as stated earlier, in order to circumvent
the reliance on rainfall for sustainable future operation of the
organization and its improved performance.

The leadership provided by the very energetic and driven
Minister of Power, Energy and Business Development Hon.
Ravi Karunanayake and Hon. Champika Premadasa, the
State Minister together with the Ministry staff, assisted the
CEB to manage and deliver an essential State service to the
expectations of the valued customers whilst simultaneously
striving to set in motion the foundations for the much
delayed generation plans.

The performances of CEB together with every Division of the
Organization in 2019 were credible and positive. This could
not have been achieved without the active participation and
contribution made by a qualitative and multi-disciplinary
Board of Directors who simultaneously stood firm on all
aspects of compliance and good corporate governance. The
Board was fortunate to have had an outstanding General
Manager/CEO to navigate the organization through a
challenging year. He and his staff were exemplary in their
commitment and dedication to the organization and in
providing a quality essential service to the Country.

| must also mention that during the year the organization
had cordial relationships with the Engineers Union and
every other Trade Union — representing a vast majority of the
work force - to have enjoyed a year of harmony without any
industrial unrest. My sincere thanks to all of the Unions for a
good year of working together.

I will be failing in my duty if | do not recognize and applaud
the support and contributions made from our subsidiaries.
Each and every one, big or small, made a meaningful positive
difference. Last but not least | would like to acknowledge
with sincere thanks the continuous quality delivery of
energy extended from our large base of Independent Power
Producers. As | reflect on my tenure at Ceylon Electricity
Board, | am truly grateful to my Board of Directors and
General Manager for the trust and confidence they invested

1 6        CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019

General Manager's Review

The sales income of CEB for
the year 2019 was recorded
as Rs. 242.95 billion.

This shows an increase of
Rs. 13.38 billion when
compared to the
previous year in which
the sales income
recorded was

Rs. 229.57 billion.

As the General Manager and the Chief Executive Officer of
the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), it is my distinct privilege
to write an assessment of the performance of the CEB during
2019, the year in which CEB celebrated its 50 years of service
to the nation.

Operational Performance

In accordance with the Vision and Mission of CEB, it is our
prime duty to meet people’s expectations of having quality
and reliable electricity supply at an affordable price. It was
a huge challenge for CEB to meet the electricity demand in
2019 when hydro power reservoir storage was depleted due
to dry weather conditions prevailed in the country, forcing
CEB to resort to thermal based power generation to meet the
daily electricity demand.

Historically, CEB had been highly dependent on hydro
power based electricity production, but with ever increasing
demand for electricity over the years and the exhaustion
of hydro resources in the country that can be developed
economically combined with the delay in implementation of
next cheaper source of coal power generation, fuel oil based
power generation options started to play a significant role in

   
 

the generation mix. Among the remaining hydro potential
available in the country, CEB’s expectations to begin
commercial operation of Uma Oya Hydro Power Plant (122
MW) and Broadlands Hydro Power Plant (35 MW) was further
delayed and these plants will not be available for commercial
operation until 2020. Further, the proposed 300MW Natural
Gas fired Combined Cycle Power Plant at Kerawalapitiya
scheduled to be commissioned in the year 2019, as the
substitute of the suddenly cancelled Sampur Coal Power
Plant in 2015, could not commence even by end of 2019. If
completed, this plant would have provided the base-load and
mid-merit generation at a significantly lower cost compared
to diesel fired thermal power plants when natural gas is made
available in Sri Lanka. The latest plans indicate that it can be
made operational in 2021.

The year 2019 is the year in which the second lowest inflows
to the catchment areas were recorded during the first half
of the year since 1990. The latter part of the year received
substantial rains but total Hydro power generation in 2019
was only 4,794.5 GWh, which is 30% of total generation
during the year. This low hydro generation was mainly due
to the very low inflows during the first half of the year which


CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019        1 /

General Manager's Review (Contd.)

was less than 900 GWh because of weak monsoons. For the
same reason, generation from privately owned mini hydro
plants also show a reduction of 17.9% in 2019 compared to
the previous year.

Under the circumstances, it became an exceptionally difficult
task for CEB to maintain the supply continuity in the country,
and CEB had no option other than to produce expensive
diesel fired power to meet the electricity demand in the
country. As a result, thermal power generation from CEB
owned plants (both oil and coal) and Independent Power
Producers (IPP) plants in 2019 amounted to 7,498 GWh and
2,875 GWh respectively. It is significant that thermal power
generation by IPPs in 2019 has increased 65.2% compared
to the previous year. Coal power plant did its best to keep the
generation costs down by contributing 5,361 GWh for the
year 2019, whichis 12.5% higher than the figure of 2018. This
is the highest recorded power production per annum by the
coal power plant from its inception.

Despite our best attempts, we were unable to fill the gap
between available generation capacity and the demand in
March and April 2019, and were compelled to allow rotational
system-wide load interruptions from 18th March 2019 to
10th April 2019 (excluding Sundays and public holidays).
However, in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday bomb attacks
electricity demand in the country was reduced relieving the
pressure on the National Grid.

The electricity generation mix in the year 2019 comprised
34% from coal, 30% from hydro power (including mini hydro),
31% from oil power plants (CEB owned and IPP) with the
balance 5% contributed by wind and other renewable energy
sources. The total energy generation in 2019 was 15,922
GWh, which was 15,374 GWh in the previous year, showing
3.6% increase in power generation in 2019. Further, the total
electricity consumption had increased to 14,611GWh in
2019, showing an increase of 3.7% compared to 2018 where
the consumption was 14,091 GWh.

The average unit cost of electricity generation was recorded
as Rs. 23.29/kWh in 2019, which was 21.8% increase from
2018 figure of Rs. 19.12/kWh. Notwithstanding this high cost
of generation, CEB provided electricity to the nation at an
average unit price of Rs. 16.63/kWh in the year 2019, which
is the principal reason for the very high operational losses
recorded in the year.

Financial Performance

As per the audited financial statement for the financial year
ended December 31, 2019, the sales income of CEB for the
2019 is recorded as Rs. 242.95 billion. This figure shows an
increase of Rs. 13.38 billion when compared to the previous
year in which the sales income recorded was Rs. 229.57
billion. This 5.83% growth resulted primarily from increase in
sales as there has been no tariff revision since 2014.

Further, the cost of sales recorded in 2018 (Rs. 251.96 billion)
has increased by Rs. 58.55 billionto Rs.310.51 billionin 2019.

This 23.24% increase in cost of sales is attributed mainly to
the significant decrease in hydro power generation which
resulted in 23.6% increase in thermal power generation. The
gross deficit of Rs. 67.56 billion recorded in the year under
review indicates an increase of Rs.45.17 billion compared
to year 2018. This increase is mainly due to the fact that
contribution from Hydro was 41.5% of total generation in
2018, whereas contribution from Hydro was only 30% in
2019. Although the Coal power plants contributed additional
12.5% during the year balance requirement had to be
produced using fuel oil plants which is 38.2% higher than
2018. Therefore, the total borrowings as at the end of the year
was Rs. 334.67 billion.

Even under a higher figure of 95 GWh of unserved energy
due to capacity deficit, CEB has recorded overall sales and
revenue growth during the year with an increase in consumer
accounts. Also, CEB has managed to reduce transmission
and distribution losses further by 1.3% to 8.23%. However,
extensive use of liquid fuel based thermal generation, low
rainfall received in the catchment areas and insufficient cash
generation from sales due to unadjusted tariff structure for
many years resulted in a Rs. 85.412 billion net loss at the end
of financial year 2019.

During the year, property, plant and equipment amounting
to Rs. 26.911 billion has been added to capital assets, while
in 2018 capital assets addition was recorded as Rs. 66.730
billion. These additions reflect mainly the assets of the
Transmission and Distribution Divisions.

CEB has been granted six licenses by Public Utilities
Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL)for Generation,
Transmission and Distribution of electricity. The Transmission
Licensee prepares Bulk Supply Tariff (BST) every six months
and Bulk Supply Transaction Account (BSTA) monthly, and
communicates same to the PUCSL as per the prevailing Tariff
Methodology and Rules. The monthly BSTA losses incurred by
the Transmission Licensee during the year 2019 account fora
considerable share of CEB’s net loss at the end of 2019 (Rs.
85.412 billion). In accordance with the Tariff Methodology
and Rules, this information needs to be communicated to
relevant parties in time with recommendations to grant
suitable tariff adjustments or subsidies to CEB to overcome
the reported losses. Timely adherence to these published
rules by relevant authorities until the next tariff revision is
implemented is vital to make CEB’s licensees financially
viable so that they can carry out the duties assigned to them
under the Sri Lanka Electricity Act. No. 20 of 2009 and Sri
Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Act No. 31 of 2013.

Technical Performance

Driven by its mission to develop and maintain an efficient,
coordinated and economical system of electricity supply in
the country, CEB has increased its customer base by 146,360
(new customers) making the total number of consumers at
the end of 2019 at 6,500,641. While CEB took every effort
to make electricity available to its customers throughout
the year during 24 hours of the day, unfortunate conditions

General Manager's Review (Contd.)

beyond its control compelled CEB to impose rotational
power interruptions in March/April 2019.

Notwithstanding this setback, CEB continued to upgrade its
transmission and distribution networks, which resulted in
increasing the length of low voltage lines by 2,294 km and
number of new distribution substations by 1,660. The line
length of 220kV overhead transmission lines was increased
by 125 km with the commissioning of New Anuradhapura-
Mannar transmission line. Another major addition to the
transmission assets in 2019 is the completion of the 220 kV
underground cable system connecting Kerawalapitiya Power
Station, Kelanitissa Power Station and new substation at
Colombo Port (L substation). This development added total
22 km of 220kV underground cables to CEB’s transmission
network. Completion of Mannar 220/132kV grid substation,
Colombo L 220/132/33kV grid substation and two other
132/11kV indoor grid substations in Colombo also took place
in2019.

We are grateful to our funding agencies, including the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), French Development Agency
(AFD) and Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA)
for continuing to support us with financial assistance in
implementing these much needed transmission projects.

During the year, construction work on generation capacity
expansion projects such as Mannar Wind Power Project,
Broadlands Hydro Power Project, Uma Oya and Moragolla
hydro power projects continued showing satisfactory
progress. Transmission projects including Green Power
Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement
Investment Program (GDP&EEIIP), National Transmission &
Distribution Network Development and Energy Efficiency
Project (NTDND&EEP), Renewable Energy Absorption
Transmission Development Project (REATDP), Power System
Reliability Strengthening Project (PSRSP) and Clean Energy
and Network Efficiency Improvement Project (CE&NEIP) also
continued with some projects nearing completion.

CEB is continuously working towards achieving the set
targets for addition of Non Conventional Renewable Energy
(NCRE) sources to the national grid while monitoring their
performances and effect on power system quality and
reliability in order to take suitable measures to mitigate such
effects efficiently and effectively as per the Grid Code and
Distribution Code.

During the year, inspection work was carried in Upper
Kothmale Reservoir after eight years of its impoundment.
Replacementofinsulation phase bus sections of Kukuleganga
Power Station was also carried out to ensure the reliability of
hydro power generation.

Towards its continued effort in reaching excellence in
customer care, CEB successfully launched the CEB Care
Mobile Application, as part of CEB utility software CEB
Assist Solutions in June 2019, making it convenient for both

customers and the CEB staff to address numerous customer
complaints. At the end of 2019, CEB Care application on 10S
and Android platforms had reached 80,000 downloads and
CEB Assist had 3,200 active internal users.

Human Resources

During the year under review, CEB has taken many measures
to improve the working environment of its employees and to
establish a disciplined, proud and contented workforce.

CEB has recruited total 718 new employees in 2019, with the
total number of permanent employees at 20,512 at the end of
2019. Training was provided to 3,489 field service employees
in 2019 by conducting over 100 training programs. In
addition, 2,656 of employees participated in 87 continuous
professional development (CPD) programs.

In line with the golden jubilee of the organization several
religious and social activities were conducted with the
participation of the ministry officials and CEB employees.
Award Ceremony of the Innovation Competitions of 2017,
2018, and 2019 was held in this year to encourage and
recognize achievements of employees in research and
development activities.

My Gratitude

CEB achieved its operational, technical and financial
performance during the year 2019 in the face of many
constraints explained above, thanks to the dedication of
employees at all levels. | am particularly grateful for the
corporation and assistance given by the Chairman and
the Members of the Board to sail through an exceptionally
difficult year in CEB’s history. | also record my gratitude to
my predecessors without whose commitment it would have
been very difficult for CEB to be in its current position. All
employees ably led by the Corporate Management Team
contributed to CEB’s achievements in the year. They all
deserve to be recognized with gratitude.

CEB needs the timely implementation of Long Term
Generation and Transmission plans in order to maintain
the policy of availability of electricity to every citizen of the
country. The continued support of authorities concerned
in approving project plans, arranging funds, approving
projects and recommending and granting necessary tariff
adjustments/subsidies for CEB in time will greatly enhance
CEB’s operational, technical and financial performance.
| close, therefore, with a humble appeal to all authorities
to assist CEB in overcoming the enormously challenging
situation the organization is facing today.

CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019         2 1

Generation Division

All the power plants owned by Ceylon Electricity Board are
operated and maintained by Generation Division. In addition,
existing power plants are rehabilitated too when requirement
arises. The Division has Hydro Power Plants with total installed
capacity of 1,398.9MW, Qil-fired Thermal Power Plants with
installed capacity of 654MW and a Coal-fired Power Plant
with installed capacity of 900MW. Total installed Capacity of
Power Plants own by CEB at the end 2019 is 2,953MW.

Performances of Power Plants

The year 2019 was not a pleasing year for Mahaweli Complex
in terms of electricity generation due to failure of both
monsoons. Even under this unpleasing situation, Power

First half of the year 2019 was extremely dry for Kukule-ganga
and consequently, the energy generated from the plants also
dropped drastically. However, continuous rain experienced
during the second half of the year made up for the shortfall of
first half and ultimately, recorded a total electricity generation
of 322 GWh for the year exceeding the annual target of 317
GWh.

North-East monsoon rainfall was not significant enough
to Inginiyagala in 2018-2019. The reservoir water level
remained in low levels same as the previous year. Water was
released in a modified and restricted pattern throughout the
year. Power generation was comparatively low in 2019 when
compared with past years.

NOISIAIQ
NOILYYINID

Plants in Mahaweli complex were in a position to generate
1,803.48 GWh of electricity. This is about 48% of the total
CEB hydro generation.

Expected annual generation of Laxapana Complex was
1550GWh. However, the period, January to July was dry.
Hence electricity generation from Laxapana Complex was

.                  not in expected levelsin 2019.
Bowatenna Power Plant surpassed its annual planned        P

generation targets while Ukuwela and Upper Kotmale Power
Plants reached 90% of their planned generation targets.

Availability Factors and Plant Factors and Fault Factors of
Power Plants are given below.

reliability of the plant could be further improved if the
availability of the coal stock could be increased. Therefore, in
order to avoid adverse consequences of poor weather, delays
in coal procurement and issues in the coal handling systems,
it was decided to enhance the coal storage and handling
capacity of the existing coal yard to be able to cater 1.21 MMT.
Cabinet approval was obtained for this and the contract was
awarded to China Machinery Engineering Corporation in
October 2019.

Rehabilitation of Frame V Gas Turbines at Kelanitissa

handled by Technicians and Engineers in CEB . Turbines
repair and replacement, fabrications of main inlet air filters
and coolers, configuration, installation and commissioning of
protection and AVR, rewiring, repair and calibration of control
and make connection to new GIS were identified as major
events of this project. Before starting the project, bids were
invited from reputed gas turbine manufactures and service

providers such as GE and MJB. However, their bids were
around LKR 7 Billion. CEB was capable enough to proceed
this project within a cost of LKR 1 Billion limit by saving LKR
6 Billion to CEB. Over 90% of work was completed in No. 4
Machine and 25% work was completed in No 5 Machine.
During the year 2019, the rehabilitated GT 1 and 2 has
supplied more than 80 GWh for the System in crisis drought
period.

Rehabilitation of Udawalawe Power Plant
Udawalawe Power Plant, which has an installed capacity of 3 x
2 MW, has been built and commissioned in 1968 to generate
electricity from the water release for irrigation purposes from
Udawalawe reservoir.

Unit 01 and Unit 02 machines are located in the left bank
and Unit 03 machine is located in the right bank of the river.
Unit 01, which is located in the left bank, is out of operations
since 1985. The annual expected energy generation by the
plant is 8 GWh. No major repair or replacement or overhaul
has been carried out since initial commissioning. Therefore,
it has been decided to give top priority of rehabilitation of this
plant under rehabilitation plan under Generation Projects
Branch for 2019. A Technical Committee was appointed
to carry out a technical feasibility study for refurbishment
and modernization and to define the scope of rehabilitation
works of Udawalawe Power Plant. An interim report prepared
by the technical committee has already been submitted to
the CEB Management.

Rehabilitation of Inginiyagala Power Plant
Inginiyagala Power Plant, which has an installed capacity of
11.25 MW has been built and commissioned in two stages in
1952 and 1962 to generate electricity from the water release
for irrigation purposes from Senanayake Samudhraya.
Since no major overhaul or refurbishment works has
been carried out up to date, this has been included in the
priority list of rehabilitation plan under Generation Projects
Branch. A Technical Committee was already appointed to
carry out a technical feasibility study for refurbishment and
modernization and to define the scope of rehabilitation

Replacement of Insulation Phase Bus (IPB) Sections
of Generators at Kukule Ganaga Power Plant

In this Power Plant, the electricity produced from generators
is transmitted up to generator transformers through
IPB sections. The power plants in this Power Plant were
commissioned in the year 2003. After two years of operation
IPB section of the Unit-2 plant failed at the generator
terminal causing a nasty fire. After this incident, number of
IPB segments of both IPB sections failed in twelve occasions
brining the machines out of service. Every time when
insulation failed at end portions of the IPB segments, they
were reused after repairing at site. Considering the effects
of energy loss, machine outages and the risk of fire etc., two
IPB sections were replaced with better quality product Moser
Galsser (MGC), Switzerland at a total cost of LKR 38.5 M.

This is a remarkable achievement of CEB since the whole
installation was done solely by the Power Plant staff after a
brief training by a couple of engineers of the supplier.. As a
result of replacement of two IPB sections, the restriction to
load the machines up to maximum capacity was relaxed.
With new IPBs, generators now can load up to their maximum
capacities (37.5MW). Since the day of installing new IPBs,
extra energy that would have lost due to loading restrictions
can be captured now. The energy captured in this year

during the South-West Monsoon periods. Suppression of
dust by spraying water and controlling of the wind flow had
been identified as feasible solutions. Water spraying systems
such as sprinkler systems, mist blowers, mist canoes etc.,
were installed at the coal yard and the ash yard to mitigate
the evolving of dust. Maintenance of wet condition at all
the operation areas was carried out successfully during the
monsoon period of 2019.

Further, another 220kV underground cable project will be
implemented through Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA) funding with an estimated base cost of USD 61
million ,in order to evacuate power from proposed Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) power plant at Kerawalapitiya,.

Technical studies on India - Sri Lanka HVDC interconnection
are being carried out and it is planned to do a complete
techno-economical study with the assistance from Asian
Development Bank (ADB) to assess the viability of the
interconnection.

Generation Development Studies Unit

Implementation of LNG power plants in the western region
of the country in different phases has been identified in the
approved Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018-2037.
Generation Development Studies unit with other relevant
governmental institutions has identified a suitable land in
Muthurajawela area to implement the above planned power
plants. In selecting the land, various technical requirements
were considered. The land has to be developed after carrying
out an Environmental Impact Assessment, because the land
is in an environmental sensitive area. The Environmental
Impact Assessment studies have been started with the Sri
Lanka Land Development Corporation. In addition, the
approval process for leasing the above land is in progress.

Under the program on “Establishing a Roadmap for the
Nuclear Power Programme in Sri Lanka”, Generation
Development Studies unit in collaboration with Generation
Planning Unit has organized four workshops in 2019 for
stakeholder organizations to enhance the knowledge of the
local officers with the assistance of IAEA. The comprehensive
report which is the final outcome is being prepared by nine
sub committees of stakeholders.

Further, Generation Development Studies Unit contributes
to identify the sites for other future power plants such as foul
point coal power plants and pumped storage power plants.

Energy Purchases Branch

Energy Purchases Branch purchases electricity from
both Thermal and Renewable Private Power Producers in
accordance to the relevant Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA) The PPAs for the thermal based plants are unique for
the particular project with a specific term while the PPAs
for the renewable based plants is a standardized one called
Standardized Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) for a Term
of 20 years.

Administrating the PPAs, making the relevant payments
accordingly, attending administrative and operational issues
are some of the responsibilities of the branch.

A comparison summary on total private power purchases in the years 2018 and 2019 is tabulated below (Table Tr-1).

Energy Marketing Branch

The Energy Marketing Branch effectively involve in
purchasing of electricity from Generation Licensees (GLs)
and sale of electricity to five Distribution Licensees (DLs)
including LECO on behalf of the Transmission Licensee (TL). It
cooperates with the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka
(PUCSL) on Regulatory related works including submission
of Bulk Supply Tariff (BST) every 6 months according to the
approved tariff methodology 2015.

Energy Marketing Branch is responsible for the preparation
and issuing of monthly invoices to DLs based on the energy
delivered to each DL. In order to measure the energy
transactions between TL and each DL, energy meters with
accuracy of 0.2 have been installed across the boundaries.
All energy meters are programmed adequately based on
relevant requirements. Energy readings are downloaded
remotely.

Going beyond the usual way of remote meter communication
based on GSM based communication, in 2018, Energy
Marketing Branch commenced a project to connect all the
energy meters remotely via fiber network with collaboration
of the Communication Branch.The first two stages of the
project were completed within 2018 and stage 3 was
completed in 2019, completing connections in 40 grid sub
stations. Downloading of meter files of the connected grids
are carried out at the Aniyakanda Meter Laboratory.

Inordertomaintaintheaccuracy oftheenergy measurements,
annual meter testing is conducted. Being concerned about
the accuracy of the CTs for the energy measurement, testing
and replacing of CTs are carried out in collaboration with
PHM units of each Distribution Division.

Energy Marketing Branch is entrusted with the preparation
of Bulk Supply Transaction Account (BSTA) to account for

energy transactions of TL. Payment for TL's energy purchases
from GL is paid through a transfer voucher. CEB DLs also pay
for their energy purchases via transfer vouchers while LECO
pays in monetary terms.

System Control Branch

The main purpose of the National System Control Centre is
to balance the electricity supply and demand in real time,
future short term and medium term operation of Sri Lankan
electricity network, while maintaining continuous, reliable
and quality power supply with the best available economical
generation plan within the stipulated network parameters. In
order toachievethis main objective, the supporting processes
such as analyzing generation options for optimum generation
plan, power network analysis for contingency planning, data
collection of generation stations and transmission network,
analyzing and reporting of various network performance
parameters, maintaining and upgrading the SCADA / EMS
system are also performed at System Control Branch. In
addition, the branch provides assistance and data materials
for various studies related to Sri Lankan power network, carry
out by internal and external parties.

The branch consists of Operations Planning Unit, System
Operations Unit, Operations Audit Unitand System Modeling
Unit functioning under DGM (System Control).

SCADA integration of New Polpitiya GSS, Colombo L, M, N
substations, Kelanitissa 33kV GIS (Gas Insulated Substation)
and Kerawalapitiya 33kV GSS were successfully completed
by System Modeling Unit during year 2019.

Power System Performance

Total Electricity generation (net) for year 2019 was 15,922.39
GWh and the demand growth compared to 2018 was 3.57%.
The contribution of NCRE (Non-Conventional Renewable
Energy) from IPP (Independent Power Producers) for year
2019 was 10.03% of the total generation and it is 163.1
GWh less than the NCRE generation of 2018. The household
rooftop solar generation contribution for 2019 was 1.1% from
the total generation. The total thermal generation for the year

2019 was 10,377.4 GWh and of that, the contribution of coal
powered electricity generation (Lakvijaya Power Plant) was
51.66%.

The hydro power generation of CEB owned plants in 2019
was 3783.5 GWh which is 26.53% reduction when compared
with 2018. This was mainly due to failure of latter part of
North-East monsoon (in January to February) and South-West
monsoon in year 2019. This is also the reason for decrease in
NCRE mini hydro generation in this year.

In the first half of year 2019, the generation sector had to
face a power shortage situation and island-wide scheduled
power cut had to be imposed in order to maintain the system
reliability. The power cut was carried out from March 18th to
April 10th 2019 and the un-served energy during that period
was 95.0 GWh.

Distribution Divisions

A major part of the electricity distribution in the country is handled by CEB amounting to 90% of the total sales volume while the
rest is taken care by the Lanka Electricity Company Ltd. (LECO), a subsidiary of the CEB.

The entire CEB distribution system is geographically separated in to four Divisions namely; Distribution Division 1 (DD1),
Distribution Division 2 (DD2), Distribution Division 3 (DD3) and Distribution Division 4 (DD4). This separation is mainly due to the
ease of administration and operations and to achieve benchmark competition to improve the efficiency and the quality of supply
to the consumers.

The distribution network consists of 33 kV and 11 kV medium voltage (MV) lines, 400 V low voltage (LV) lines and distribution
transformers that transferring power from 220 kV and 132 kV transmission systems through grid substations spread island wide.

Operational Structure
Each Division is headed by an Additional General Manager who directly reports to the General Manager, CEB. Distribution

Divisions are divided into Provinces and each Province is headed by a Deputy General Manager. Provinces that come under each
Division are given below:

Projects Division

The year 2019 had been another challenging year for the
Projects Division, as it handled and carried out projects work
worth of SLRs. 36 billion during the year under review.

It was broadly discussed in many forum on the options
available for the future power generation projects and
predominantly said to be greener than ever due to global
warming and connected other issues. Accordingly, CEB is
looking forward much greener projects than ever. Description
of the Project activities that had been carried out is as follows:

Mannar Wind Power Project (MWPP)

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) awarded the EPC contract
to Vestas Asia Pacific AS, a world-renowned Danish wind
turbine manufacturer, to build the first large scale wind farm
in Sri Lanka, in the Southern coast of Mannar island. Project
comprises of 30 numbers of state-of-the-art wind turbines,
each rated to 3.45 MW and total installed capacity of this
wind farm is 103.5 MW. This is a culmination of a long-term
effort by CEB to develop wind power in a large-scale manner
exploiting the major monsoonal wind systems in Sri Lanka.
In this project, CEB intends to harness power from wind
in a large scale manner, on the same lines as it did with the
hydropower potential in the last century.

 

Site works in progress- MWPP

 

Installation works in progress - MWPP

Funding required for this wind farm and other associated
facilities in Mannar and Anuradapura has been arranged
through a loan provided by Asian Development Bank.
The project is also supported with a consultancy service

contract with COWI AS of Denmark and Warranty Operations
and Maintenance contract (WOM contract) for the initial
three-year period. Total investment for the wind farm is
approximately 141 MUSD. Once commissioned, Mannar
wind farm could supply more than 380 million units of clean
electricity to the national grid annually. Electricity from this
project can be generated less than 5.0 US Cents/kWhr. One
of the major benefits of this project is its ability to displace
large amount of fossil fuel base electricity generation and
thereby avoiding emissions amounting to 285,000 metric-
tonnes of CO, to the environment, annually.

Mannar wind farm will be operated as a semi-dispatchable
power plant supported with advance wind forecasting
system to optimize & control the wind generated electricity
to the national grid. This is in addition to the bird detection
RADAR system to implement selective shut down of wind
turbines to avoid bird collisions, if any.

Mannar Wind Farm is implemented as a benchmark project
to ascertain the possibility of integrating large scale wind
plants to the national grid with relevant grid support facilities.
The project is also planned in line with the Government's
policy target to achieve 20% nonconventional renewable
power generation by year 2020.

The project work commenced in March 2019. All preliminary
site development works have been completed. Designing
of the wind turbine equipment is completed and deliveries
of the plant and equipment to the site are in progress via
Trincomalee and Colombo ports. Further to the wind farm civil
works, construction of new service roads and rehabilitation
of existing road network in the project area are being carried
out. The project is schedule to be completed by November
2020.

Broadlands Hydropower Project (BHPP)

The Broadlands Hydropower Project is a run-of-river type
project planned to build in the Kelani River. The key objective
of the project is to harness the hydro potential downstream
of the existing Polpitiya Power Station. The project will have
an installed capacity of 35 MW. The main sites of the project
are located about 90km north - east of Colombo, near the
town Kithulgala. Main components included in the project
are main dam, diversion dam, main tunnel, diversion tunnel,
power station with two 17.5MW turbine generator units,
switch yard and transmission line. The Broadlands plant is
planned to generate 126 GWh of electrical energy annually.
However, Ceylon Electricity Board has decided to maintain a
firm water release to safeguard White Water Rafting sport in
Kithulgala area and as a result there will be a reduction in the
annual energy generation. The water release is done through
a Mini Hydropower Plant to minimize the loss in generation.
The Cabinet approval for project implementation on
Design & Build basis was granted in 2006 by securing funds

arranged by the successful contractor. After the successful
evaluation of the bids China National Electric Equipment
Corporation (CNEEC) was selected as the main Contractor
of the project and contract agreement was signed in end of
2010. The total project cost is 82 MUSD. The 85% of funding
is provided by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) and the balance was obtained from Hatton National
Bank. The loan agreements with two banks were signed in
2013. The Contractor mobilized to the site and commenced
construction works in August 2013.

Construction works are in Progress in parallel at Main Dam,
Main Tunnel, Diversion Tunnel, Power House & Switchyard
Site. The physical progress is 70% as at end 2019 and the
Project is scheduled to be completed in January 2021.

The Broadlands Hydropower Project is the first large scale
hydropower plant which has obtained CDM registration in
Sri Lanka.

Moragolla Hydropower Project (MHPP)

The MHPP is one of several hydropower projects identified
by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) to reduce the role
of fossil-fueled power generation, which has outstripped
hydropower over the past 30 years as readily exploitable

DIVISION

 


72          CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019

Corporate Strategy Division

Corporate Strategy Division is headed by the Additional
General Manager (Corporate Strategy), consists of five
Branches namely Business & Operational Strategy Branch,
Corporate Strategy & Regulatory Affairs Branch, Functional
Strategy & Process Development Branch, Information
Technology (IT) Branch and Research & Development
Branch. The performances, during the year of each Branch,
headed by Deputy General Manager, are stated herein. The
project; Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) headed by a
Project Director, is also functioning under the purview of
Additional General Manager (Corporate Strategy).

Corporate Strategy & Regulatory Affairs Branch

The Corporate Strategy and Regulatory Affairs (CS&RA)
Branch co-ordinates the matters arising from and related to
Generation, Transmission and Distribution Licenses issued to
the Ceylon Electricity Board among the respective Licensees
as well as with the Public Utility Commission of Sri Lanka
(PUCSL) with respect to licensing requirements. In addition
to handling regulatory affairs, this Branch is responsible for
coordinating the Corporate Strategy formulation for CEB.

During the year, Regulatory Affairs Unit worked closely
with Licensees as well as with PUCSL to meet the licensing
requirements of all CEB licensees. In particular, the focus
of the unit was to see implementation of the regulations
such as Electricity (Distribution) Performance Standards,
Electricity (Transmission) Performance Standards, Electricity
(Safety, Quality and Continuity) Regulation and Electricity
(Utility-Driven Demand Side Management) Regulation by
licensees and took a lot of initiatives towards achieving
the same. In addition to the above, Regulatory Affairs Unit
worked with PUCSL as well as CEB licensees to improve
wayleave guidelines and also to formulate a new guideline
for investigation of suspected alteration of the register of the
electricity meter.

As previous years, no end user tariff adjustment was made
during 2019. As there were delays and problems observed
both in lowering the cost of generation by acquiring low cost
generation and also in passing down the actual cost to end
use customers by way of tariffs, the only remaining option
left for CEB was to shift the consumption from times where
cost of electricity is high to times where cost of electricity is
low. Already, all bulk consumers were mandatorily placed on
Time of Use (ToU) tariffs. But there is no such compulsion for
retail consumers including domestic customers that consist
of over 85% of total customer base. In 2017, ToU tariff was
extended to all domestic consumers too as an optional
tariff. However, as the response from domestic consumers
to migrate to ToU was poor, a media campaign to educate
the ToU option to domestic customers was done with the
assistance of TELECINE Television Institute in 2019.

A study on developing a pre-paid metering solution to CEB,
under ADB funding, was initiated in year 2019 aiming to
launch pre-paid metering solution.

In line with corporate strategy function, the Branch
undertook the task of compiling and publishing of the
corporate documents of CEB including Corporate Plan of
CEB for the period 2019-2023 , Action Plan for the same
period, Annual Report — 2018, Statistical Digest - 2018, Sales
and Generation Data Book — 2018, Performance 2019 and
Programs for 2020 etc.

Functional Strategy & Process Development Branch

Driven by the continued demand for Operational, Functional
and Personnel Manuals by executives and non-executives
across CEB employee profile, the FS&PD Branch continued
its effort to produce new Manuals as well as to complete the
Manuals already undertaken. In that respect, the preparation
of Manuals such as ‘Operating Manual - DGM (P&D)’,
‘Operating Manual - DGM (C&C)’, ‘Operating Manual - DFM
(Dist.)’, Personnel Manual - Salaries & Wages’ and ‘Operating
Manual - Holiday, Holiday Pay, and Lieu Leave & Overtime’
were completed ahead of the scheduled time. Sinhala
translation of the ‘Rules of Disciplinary Procedures’ was
completed and the same was printed for distribution, while
the Tamil translation of the same completed by the translator
was taken up for review by a panel of CEB officers.

Branch has decided to outsource the production of some
of the Manuals belonging to Transmission and Distribution
Divisions as a pilot project due to the high demand for
completing the Manuals.

The Board Papers for the restructuring of the Personnel
Branch and the Training Branch, which were considered
timely and essential to improve the overall performance of the
organization, were prepared based on the recommendations
ofthe committee set up for restructuring. The Board Paper for
the restructuring of Personnel Branch was already submitted
to the Board while the draft Board Paper for Training Branch is
still under review by relevant authorities.

In the meantime, a coordinated effort from various sections of
the CEB was initiated to prepare proposals for legal, structural
and administrative changes to transform the organization
in to a vibrant and efficient entity, through a taskforce
committee headed by AGM (CS). The committee made
several discussions and deliberations up to the end of the
year and continued work to finalize a report on the same. The
final report will be submitted to the Corporate Management
Team (CMT) to be further refined and submitted to the Board.

The Branch continued to upload the Circulars Manuals and
Documents System (CMDS) with latest contents as and when
they were published and circulated. CMDS has become
one of the frequently accessed information sources for CEB

employees. The fine tuning of the system was continued
with the continuous uploading of the contents. As per
the requirements of the Corporate Plan 2019 - 2023, the
draft Continuous Improvement Policy was also prepared.
In addition, a number of already published Manuals were
reprinted to cater the increasing demand from various
Divisions.

The Branch continued to assist the management to compile
responses for the parliamentary queries raised by Select
Committees, Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE),
Members of the Parliament, Ministry of Power and Energy,
Government Organizations etc., by coordinating the relevant
Divisions for which the queries were targeted and with
the CEB management, to ensure consistent consolidated
responses are forwarded to the Management, Chairman and
line Ministry for appropriate actions.

Business & Operational Strategy Branch

Formulating strategies for CEB’s key business and operational
activities, monitoring the organizational performance on
strategy execution and improvement of corporate image and
corporate culture of CEB are the key activities of the Business
& Operational Strategy Branch.

CEB celebrated Golden Jubilee on 15 November 2019 after
its establishment in year 1969. In order to commemorate this
significant occasion, CEB organized several events during
2019. B & OS Branch took a leading role in this exercise by
carrying our public awareness campaign in all print and
electronic media. Achievement of 100% electrification in
2019 and energy conservation were the main themes behind
this campaign. With the assistance of B & OS Branch, new
customer care mobile app to CEB customers and CEB History
Book were launched in year 2019.

In 2019, B&OS Branch and Environmental Unit of CEB have
undertaken a tree planting program of 50,000 plants in CEB
power stations and other premises. In order to accomplish
all these events successfully, B&OS Branch contributed its
service significantly.

 

 

Awarding ceremony of Innovation competitions of year
2017,2018, 2019 were held on 2019-11-01 in line with 50th
Anniversary of CEB.

In order to improve the performances of the CSCs, CEB has
decided to continue the star rating program in year 2019 as
well. All customer service centers of Southern Province, some
of North Western Province and some of Western Province
North CSCs have achieved their one star by the end of year
2019. Branch has conducted several awareness programs on
star rating program in order to encourage all CSCs to achieve
at least one star level.

management, service connections, and human resource
management.

CEB’s own Point of Sales counters credit card payments
through web, Electric Vehicle Charging solution and KIOSK
machines are in operation for acceptance of customer
payments. A SMS notification system is in operation to inform
customers of the power interruptions and to send reminders
on bill payments and disconnection notices. A SMART phone
application is being developed for customers to inform their
electricity breakdowns promptly. It is expected that this
application will considerably solve the call center congestions
experienced currently during peak hours.

A major step for IT Branch envisaged will be setting the CEB
private cloud setup with next generation security solution,
where IT core infrastructure is ready to provide industry
standard IT services. This industry stand solution with
Disaster recovery setup and automated Business continuity
process will consolidate all the IT systems in CEB and
facilitate the rapid infrastructure provisioning for the future IT
systems. The procurement and implementation ground work
had been laid for this target during the last year.

The WAN of CEB now has about 500 nodes connected
by leased data lines and our own fiber. Significant cost
reductions have been achieved in procuring leased data lines
due to stiff competition among telecommunication service
providers. IT Branch has started to upgrade the Local Area
Networks to the industry standard with facilities to cater

toimplementthe smart metering and smartgrid pilot projects
to embark CEB’s journey to the next level of digitization and
to implement and manage backend operations of CEB’s
seven EVCS.

IT Branch has identified the requirement of training the users
of many applications regularly. Many training programs are
conducted through the Training Branch for this purpose. In
addition, itis also identified the importance of training IT staff
with appropriate technology as per the needs of the systems
supported. We need to have a confident and motivated IT

Side Management Unit, Research & Development Unit, and
Regional Centre for Lighting.

Demand Side Management Unit

The electricity system load profile of Sri Lanka has a high
evening peak. Management of system Load Profile is a
primary objective of Demand Side Management (DSM) Unit.
A promotion for optional ToU domestic tariff was conducted
in the light of load shifting and valley filling (load at evening
peak to off peak) the annual load factor, continues to show
a clear increasing trend. Distribution of LED lamps among
identified domestic customers by Distribution Divisions
is also another DSM measure taken in order to reduce the
evening peak. Necessary measures were taken to initiate
Load Research Program (LRP) in selected Provinces after
analyzing data gathered from the LRP program conducted in
Eastern Province. DSM Unit further conducted walk through
energy audits for selected customers among requests as
a program initiated to celebrate the 50th anniversary of
CEB. An awareness program for bulk customers of WPN
was conducted and common findings and the measures
identified for energy efficiency improvement from energy
audits were discussed with the aim of improving the energy
efficiency culture among customers. Awareness programme
on energy efficacy of industries has been also conducted in
Seethawaka Export processing zone.

A CEB research team has been actively involving in a research
Project of “Development of a Poly Phase Smart Electronic
Energy Meter with total facilitation from R&D Branch. Primary

Research and Development Unit

With the expectation of nourishing the research and
developmental activities conducted in CEB, R&D unit
coordinates researches in variety of identified research
topics. Solar hosting capacity calculation model was one
such outcome of the research titled “Impact of roof-top solar
on LC network” which was developed through the study and
it has been distributed among Area offices of CEB. Through
the model, the Area Engineers are facilitated to make initial
decisions on solar hosting capacity of a feeder at a given
location. Further, the researches “Assessment of lightning
effects on distribution network and finding feasible solutions
for high lightning prone areas” and “Study of solar PV and
battery hybrid systems” were successfully completed in the
year.

Monthly seminars for presenting postgraduate research
work/thesis by CEB employees were conducted at the
Research & Development Branch. Thirty five research
presentations from the sectors of distribution, transmission,

accuracy of the optimization of the model had been validated
by the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication,
University of Moratuwa using particle swam optimization. The
enclosure with optimized parameters for a certain generator
was manufactured and the sound pressure measurements
were analyzed with the output of the optimized mathematical
model. The final report was submitted to DGM (WS&AS) to
consider in future procurement of generator set.

R&D Branch created a documentary video of distribution
substation maintenance. This documentary will be used
for dissemination of the knowledge of best practice in
maintenance of distribution substations.

A team of CEB Engineers under the leadership of Research
and Development Branch has been engaging in “Design of
a grid tie inverter for commercial and household solar power
installations based on the solid state transformer topology”.

CEB has decided to embark on electric vehicle charging
stations (EVCSs) in order to regulate the business and as a
valley filling DSM measure. CEB commissioned seven EVCS at
Anuradhapura, Kandy,Avissawella, Nuwara Eliya, Pannipitiya
and Dehiwala and they are in operation. Further, actions were
taken to procure ten more EVCS in 2019.

Regional Centre for Lighting (RCL)

 

 

 

 

 

 

EVCS at Pannipitiya

The objectives of RCL are:

- Increase the awareness and affordability of energy
efficient, reliable and clean lighting technologies and their
applications to reduce electricity demand by lighting.

- Catalyze regional manufacturing of energy efficient

lighting products to improve the economy of the region
- Make lighting affordable to many under privileged
citizens
- Train and educate necessary workforce in the region to
create sustainable lighting in South Asia.

Product Testing

RCL has a fully equipped accredited photometry laboratory.
It has two integrating spheres with diameters 1m and 2m
and a goniometer as major equipment. This is the first ever
goniometer in Sri Lanka capable of capturing intensity
distribution of luminaires.

RCL performs testing of photometric and electrical
parameters of conventional lighting products and solid state
lighting (SSL) products. At present, a labelling programme is
enforced on all imported CFL lamps by Sri Lanka Standards
Institution. All CFLs have to meet the requirements of SLS
1231 and SLS 1225. RCL performs the role of testing of the
imported CFL samples for their compliance with above
mentioned SLS standards. Moreover, RCL conducts testing
of LED products as per the standard IEC 62612 and testing
of LED samples for their compliance with SLS 1530:2016,
Sri Lanka Standard Minimum Energy Performance Standard
(MEPS) for Self Ballasted LED lamps for General Lighting
Services.

Consultancy Services

R&D Branch provides consultancy services on DSM related
assignments including energy auditing, lighting related
assignments including lighting designing.

Enterprise Resource Planning

The Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system of CEB
will automate business processes in view of integrating
information across the entire organization. Information
that was previously fragmented in different systems can
seamlessly flow throughout the organization so that it can
be shared by different business processes in customer
relationship management, financing, procurement, human
resource management, asset management, maintenance
management etc. Discrete business processes from
Generation, Transmission, Distribution and Centralized
Service would be integrated so that information will flow
across the organization at all levels.

The ERP Project of the CEB progressed well during the year
2019. CEB managed to obtain 10 MUSD concessionary
loan financing from Asian Development Bank for the
implementation of the Project. After carrying out the
necessary changes to the Bidding Documents to suit for the
ADB requirements, the ERP Project tender was advertised on
07th November 2019 and the bid is now under evaluation.
It is envisaged to complete the Phase 01 of the Project in 02
years and the Phase 02 of the Project in another 01 year.

Finance Division &
Financial Information

FINANCE DIVISION

Finance Division, through nine Additional Finance Managers
Branches across CEB in island wide operates financial
management functions such as cash management, financial
planning, treasury management, financial and management
reporting, statutory relations, budgeting, taxation and
corporate & project finance to facilitate growth of business
activities. Its primary responsibility is to ensure all financial
decisions are based on sound criteria which contribute to
cost efficiencies across CEB.

Financial Performance

The year 2019 was financially critical for CEB as net loss was
recorded as LKR 85.42 Billion which was the highest financial
loss endured by CEB since inception. The operating losses
were recorded continuously throughout the year as no
sufficient rainfalls were received from monsoons as expected
where the major hydro plants contribution to total generation
was limited to 24%. The poor financial performance
deteriorated the retained earnings to a negative balance.
The net loss of LKR 85.4 Billion was a 167% downturn in
comparison to year 2018 which recorded a restated net loss
of LKR 31.9 Billion.

CEB was able to achieve a 99% electrification level by end
of year 2019 and the growth rate of electricity unit sales
was limited to 4% against previous year where the increase
in rupee value was at 6%.The increase in revenue was solely
attributable to the expansion in demand as the tariff was
stagnant since year 2014 due to government policy decision.

Figure 03 : Cost Structure

The increase in direct generation cost was 32% compared
to year 2018 which was attributed by the 4% increase in
generation. Consequently with poor hydro conditions the
generation from oil fired IPP thermal plants was increased
and escalation of commodity prices resulted in worsening
the financial performance.

This cost escalation negatively affected the cost of generation
where the cost per unit at the generation point in 2019
recorded at 15.74 Rs. / kWh and in 2018 it was 12.75 Rs. /
kWh. The cost of sales at the selling point to end consumer
of CEB stood at 23.29 Rs. /kWh for year 2019 and 19.12 Rs. /
kWh for year 2018. Accordingly cost of sales at selling point
has increased by 22% compared to the previous year.

Borrowing and Cost of Finance

Finance cost was considerable in year 2019 with the increase
in borrowings to finance working capital requirements along
with the self-negotiated borrowings to finance CEB projects
in developing electricity infrastructure. Furthermore, cash
deficiency has led to delay payments to major suppliers
namely Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and IPP’s which
has caused CEB a significant delay interest.

Financial Position

Being the pioneer in the energy sector, CEB is holding LKR
914 Billion worth of assets where approximately 85% of the
same is composed with fixed assets. Further, CEB carried LKR
48 Billion of inventory as at the balance sheet date of year
ending 2019 and capital infusions from the government was
significant in the equity.

Being a financially difficult year, the liquidity of CEB was
hindered raising the overdraft limit to LKR 9 Billion and
increasing the interest bearing loans and borrowings
significantly.

Impact of Government Policy to Fix End User Tariff

CEB offers electricity tariff at a price which is lower than the
cost at the selling point as a government policy, to most of
the tariff categories excluding general purpose and high
consumption domestic consumers.

Accordingly, the net loss to the CEB financial statements due
to fixing of a low tariff as a government policy is as follows:

Treasury Management

The Treasury function in any corporate has always been
important in making sure that the business has sufficient
liquidity to make its obligations, whilst managing payments,
receipts, financial risks effectively.

In year 2016 Board of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)
decided to establish a separate Treasury Management
Branch (TMB) in order to manage its funds effectively. 2017
CEB obtained AAA rating from Fitch Ratings Lanka (Pvt) Ltd
and since then it maintains the best possible ratings status
that an organization could achieve.

Last 2 years CEB was in a demanding position in negotiating
debt instruments (Specially Term Loans from Banks) in much
more favorable way to CEB as a whole.

In 2019 CEB decided to issue a LKR 20 Billion debenture issue
by selecting People’s Bank after considering their proposal.
This will be a milestone not only in CEB but also in state
owned enterprises (SOE) as a whole.

CEB Treasury Management Branch is in process of
implementing separate Management Information System
(MIS) to manage the key activities of the Provident Fund.

Collection Management

The following initiatives were taken place during the year to
facilitate the consumer regarding the electricity bill payment
more convenience and efficient

+ Acceptance of Visa cards at CEB POS counters since
March 2019.

+ Implementation of online Real time updating of
electricity bill payments via existing collection agents:
National Development Bank PLC, Sampath Bank PLC,
HDFC Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC.

+ Implemented a new master invoice facility for corporate
consumers.

+ Extend electricity bill payments via dialog Genie app,
NTB FriMi app.

+ Implemented standing order electricity bill payments
via Sampath bank and Commercial bank

Switchgear (Pvt) Ltd                                       as at 31 December 2019. Control is achieved when
Feni Lanka Power Limited           Bangladesh                    the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns

from its involvement with the investee and has the
ability to affect those returns through its power over
the investee. Specifically, the Group controls and
investee if, and only if, the Group has:

- Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that
give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee)

- Exposure, or rights, to variable return to its
involvement with the investee

- The ability to its power over the investee to affect its
returns

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority
of voting rights results in control. To support this
presumption and when the Group has less than a
majority of a voting or similar rights of an investee, the
Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances
in assessing whether it has power over an investee,
including:

- the contractual arrangement with the other vote
holders of the investee

- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements

- The Group's voting rights and potential voting
rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an
investee, if facts and circumstances indicate that there
are changes to one or more of the three elements of
control. Consolidation of subsidiary begins when the
Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases
when the Group losses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary
acquired or disposed of during the year are included
in the consolidated financial statements from the
date the Group gains control until the date the Group
ceases to control the subsidiary.

Profit or loss and each component of other
comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the
equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the
non-controlling interests, even if this results in the
non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statement of assets and liabilities, equity, income,
expenses and cash flows relating to the transaction
between the members if the Group are eliminated
in full on consolidation. A change in the ownership
interest of the subsidiary, without a loss of control, is
accounted for as an equity transaction.

If the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it
recognises the related assets (including goodwill),
liabilities, non-controlling interest and other
components of equity while any resultin gain or loss is
recognized in profit or loss. Any investment retained is
recognised at fair value.

Going Concern

The directors have made an assessment of the Group's
ability to continue as a going concern and they do not
intend either to liquidate or to cease trading except for
the following

Going Concern - Heladhanavi Limited

The Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) dated 09 May
2009 signed between Heladhanavi Ltd and Ceylon
Electricity Board expired on 08 December 2014. From
the entity point of view there is a material uncertainty
about the entity’s ability to continue asa going concern
upon expiry of the agreement.

The directors have made an assessment of the
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern as at
the reporting date and they decided that there is a

2.2

significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue
as a going concern. Therefore, the going concern
assumption is not appropriate in the preparation of
financial statements of Heladhanavi Limited.

Going Concern - Lanka Industrial Products

Engineering (Pvt) Limited

The directors have decided to cease its operations
with effect from 01 November 2015 and to transfer
its operations to LTL Transformers (Pvt) Ltd. Hence,
the going concern assumption has not been adopted
in preparing financial statements of Lanka Industrial
Products Engineering (Pvt) Ltd.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

2.2.1 Jointly Control Entity

Ajoint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby
the parties that have joint control of the arrangement
have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint
control is the contractually agreed sharing of control
of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions
about the relevant activities require unanimous
consent of the parties sharing control. Trincomalee
Power Company Limited is a jointly controlled entity
between Ceylon Electricity Board and NTPC Limited.
The considerations made in determining joint control
are similar to those necessary to determine control
over subsidiaries.

The Board’sinvestmentinitsjointventureisaccounted
for using the equity method. Under the equity method,
the investment in a joint venture is initially recognized
at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is
adjusted to recognize changes in the Board’s share
of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition
date. Goodwill relating to the joint venture is included
in the carrying amount of the investment and is not
tested for impairment individually. The statement of
profit or loss reflects the Board's share of the results of
operations of the joint venture. Any change in OCI of
the investee is presented as part of the Board's OCI.

In addition, when there has been a change recognized
directly in the equity of the joint venture, the Board
recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable,
in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealized
gains and losses resulting from transactions between
the Board and the joint venture are eliminated to
the extent of the interest in the joint venture. The
aggregate of the Board's share of profit or loss of a joint
venture is shown on the face of the statement of profit
or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or
loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the joint
venture.

Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

Year Ended 31st December 2019

2.2.2 Foreign Currency Translation

a).

b).

c).

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements are
measured using the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity
operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial
statements are presented in “Sri Lanka Rupees”,
which is considered the entity’s functional and
presentation currency.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded
at the functional currency using the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting
from the settlement of such transactions and
from the translation at year-end exchange rates
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognised in the statement
of Comprehensive Income.

In terms of sub section 06 of the 42 of the Ceylon
Electricity Board Act No: 17 of 1969, CEB does not
take account of any gains or losses arising from
exchange fluctuations , in respect of the capital
and interest on foreign currency loans obtained
through the Treasury as the exchange rate risk
is borne by the Government of Sri Lanka. The
outstanding loans repayable are valued at the
agreed exchange rate at the time of receipt of the
loan by CEB.

Foreign operations

The statement of financial position and the
statement of comprehensive income of overseas
subsidiaries, which are foreign operations, are to
be translated to Group's presentation currency as
follows.

+ Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.

* Income and expenses are translated at the
average exchangerate forthe period, unlessthis
average rate is not a reasonable approximation
of the rate prevailing at the transaction date, in
which case income and expenses are translated
at the exchange rate ruling at the transaction
date.

» Theexchangedifferences arising on transaction
for consolidation are recognised in other
comprehensive income.

2.2.3 Taxation

a).

b)

Current Taxes

The tax expense for the period comprises current
and deferred tax. Current income tax assets and
liabilities for the current and prior periods are
measured at the amount expected to be recovered
from or paid to the Commissioner General of
Inland Revenue. The tax rate and the tax laws
used to compute the amounts are those that are
enacted or substantively enacted on the reporting
date in the country where the Board and the Group
companies operate and generate taxable income.

Tax is recognised in statement of comprehensive
income, except that a change attributable to an
item of income or expense recognised as other
comprehensive income is also recognised directly
in other comprehensive income. Current income
tax relating to items recognised directly in equity
is recognised in equity and not in the statement of
profit or loss.

The provision for income tax is based on the
elements of Income and expenditure as reported
in the Financial Statements and computed in
accordance with the provision of the Inland
Revenue Act.

Deferred Taxation

Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability
method, on all temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the financial statements.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for
all taxable temporary differences except where the
deferred income tax liability arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
that is not a business combination and, at the time
of transaction that is not a business combination
and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all
deductible temporary differences, carry-forward
of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary
differences, and the carry-forward of unused
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized
except, where the deferred income tax assets
relating to the deductible temporary differences
arisen from the initial recognition of an asset or
liability in a transaction that is not a business
combination and, at the time of transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or
loss.

Year Ended 31st December 2019

2.2.4

2.2.5

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets
is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the
deferred income tax asset to be utilized.

In respect of taxable temporary differences associated
with investment in subsidiaries, associates and
interests in joint ventures, except where the timing
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be
controlled and it is probable that the temporary
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at
each reporting date and are recognised to the extent
that it has become probable that future taxable profits
will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

In respect of deductible temporary differences
associated with investment in subsidiaries, associates
and interests in joint ventures deferred tax assets are
only recognized to the extent thatitis probable thatthe
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable
future and taxable profit will be available against which
the temporary differences can be utilized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured
at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year
when the asset is realized or the liability is settled,
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been
enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting
date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised in
correlation to the underlying transaction either in
other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
when the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable
entity and the same taxation authority.

Borrowing Costs

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that
the Board incurs in connection with the borrowing of
funds. General and specific borrowing costs directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of qualifying assets, which are assets that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get
ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All
other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in
which they are incurred.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net
realisable value, after making due allowances for
obsolete and slow moving items. Net realisable value
is the price at which inventories can be sold in the

2.2.6

2.2.7

ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of
completion and the estimated cost necessary to make
the sale. The costincurred in bringing inventories to its
present location and condition is accounted as follows.

Inventory which are mostly used and listed in the
Annual Price List are valued at Standard Price in the
Distribution Divisions and others (Generation and
Transmission Divisions) such as consumables and
spares at First in First out valuation method.

However, the Board made provision for unrealized
profit of the inventory which is valued at Standard
Price to enable to bring down the value to cost.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and Cash equivalents are defined as cash in
hand, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid
investments, readily convertible to known amounts
of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes
in value. For the purpose of Group statement of cash
flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in
hand and deposits in banks net of outstanding bank
overdrafts. Investments with short maturities, i.e.
three months or less from the date of acquisition are
also treated as cash equivalents.

Property, Plant and Equipment
a) Cost & Valuation

Property, Plant & Equipment is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment losses, if any. Such cost include the
cost of replacing components, parts of the Property
Plant & Equipment and borrowing costs for the
long term construction projects if the recognition
criteria are met. When significant parts of Property


CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019

113

Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

Year Ended 31st December 2019

Plant & Equipment are required to be replaced at
intervals, the Group derecognises the net book
value of the replaced part, and recognises the
new part with its own associated useful life and
depreciation. Likewise, when a major inspection
is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying
amount of the plant & equipment as a replacement,
if the recognition criteria are satisfied.

When items of Property, Plant & Equipment are
subsequently revalued, the entire class of such
assets is revalued. Any revaluation surplus is
recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated equity in the asset revaluation reserve,
except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation
decrease of the same asset previously recognised
in the statement of profit or loss, in which case the
increase is recognised in the statement of profit
or loss. A revaluation deficit is recognised in the
statement of profit or loss, except to the extent
that it offset and existing surplus on the same asset
recognised in the asset revaluation reserve.

Accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation
date is eliminated against the gross carrying
amount of the asset and the net amount is restated
to the revalued amount of the asset. Upon disposal
any revaluation reserve relating to the particular
asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.

b) Capital work in progress

c)

Capital work- in — progress is stated at cost. These
are expenses of a capital nature directly include
in the construction work of long term capital
projects. Expenses that are in the capital nature are
accounted for as capital work- in -progress until the
projects are completed and the related assets are
available for use.

De-recognition

The carrying amount of an item of Property Plant &
Equipment is derecognized on disposal or when no
future economic benefits are expected from its use.
The gain or losses arising from de-recognition of
an item of Property Plant & Equipment is included
in the statement of profit or loss when the item is
derecognized.

When replacement costs are recognized in the
carrying amount of an item of Property Plant &
Equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the
replaced parts are derecognized. Major inspection
costs are capitalized. At each such capitalization,
the remaining carrying amount of the previous cost
of inspections is derecognized.

d) Non-current Assets Held for Sale

e)

f)

The Group classifies non -current assets as held
for sale if the carrying amounts will be recovered
principally through a sale rather than through
continuing use. Such non - current assets classified
as held for sale are measured at the lower of their
carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell .

The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded
as met only when the sale is highly probable on the
approval granted by the management.(Board of
Directors).The management must be committed to
the sale expected within six months of the date of
classification.

The Deprecation is ceased upon the classification of
the Property Plant and equipment as held for sale.

Asset and liabilities classified as held for sale
are presented separately as current items in the
statement of financial position.

Once such asset is identified as “non-current assets
held for sale” it should be disposed within 06
months from the Board decision. If not disposed
it should be reclassified under Property Plant &
Equipment (PPE) again along with the depreciation
adjustment for the period ceased for depreciation.

Restoration Cost

Expenditure incurred on repair or maintenance of
Property, Plant & Equipment in order to restore or
maintain the future economic benefits expected
from originally assessed standard of performance is
recognised as an expense when incurred.

Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated by using straight line
basis over the useful life of the asset when the
asset is available for use other than free hold land.
Building on Leasehold land is depreciated over the
shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and
lease term.

Assets which costuptoRs.15,000 are fully depreciated
Leases
Policy applicable from 1st January 2019

At inception of a contract, the Board assesses whether
a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to
control the use of an identified asset for a period of
time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether
a contract conveys the right to control the use of an
identified asset, the Board uses the definition of a lease
in SLFRS 16.

This policy is applied to contracts entered into, on or
after 1st January 2019.

2.2.8.1 Group as a Lessee

The CEB assesses whether a contract is or contains
a lease at inception of the contract. This assessment
involves the exercise of judgement about whether it
depends on a specified asset, whether the CEB obtains
substantially all the economic benefits from the use of
that assets, and whether the CEB has right to direct the
use of the asset.

The CEB recognizes right-of-use (ROU) assets and a
lease liability at the lease commencement date, except
for short term leases of 12 months or less which are
expensed in the income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest
rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily


determined, CEB uses an incremental borrowing
rate. Lease payments can include fixed payments;
variable payments that depend on an index or rate
known at the commencement date; and extension
option payments or purchase options, if CEB is
reasonably certain to exercise. The lease liability is
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest rate method and remeasured (with a
corresponding adjustment to the related ROU assets)
when there is a change in future lease payments in
case of renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or in
case of reassessment of options.

At inception, the ROU asset comprises the initial
lease liability, initial direct costs and the obligations to
refurbish the asset, less any incentives granted by the
lessors. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter
of the lease term or the estmated useful life of the
underlying asset.

The ROU asset is subject to testing for impairment
if there is an indicator for impairment, as for owned
assets.

ROU assets are included in the heading property, plant
and equipment, and the lease liability is included in
the headings current and non-current interest bearing
loans and borrowings.

2.2.8.2 Group as a Lessor - LTL

Operating Lease

Hydro power, wind power and thermal power plants
in which the Group does not transfer substantially all
the risk and benefits of ownership of the assets are
classified as operating lease. Lease income from all
power plants is recognised in the statement of profit
or loss based on energy output for the period which is
more representative of the time pattern in which use
benefits derived from leased assets are diminished.
Cost including depreciation incurred in earning
the lease income is recognised as an expense. The
depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets is
consistent with Group’s depreciation policy for similar
assets.

Finance Lease

The group is of the view that the substance of the
arrangements between Raj Lanka Power Company
Ltd and Bangladesh Power Development Board
and Lakdhanavi Bangala Power Ltd and Bangladesh
Power Development Board fall within the purview
of “IFRIC 4- Determining whether an arrangement
contains a Lease” and to be accounted as a lease under
“SLFRS-16- Leases” due to the satisfaction of following
criterion;

- The fulfilment of the arrangement under the Power
Purchase Agreement is dependent on the exclusive
use of the specific power plant of the Group situated
in Bangladesh

2.2.9

CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019

Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

Year Ended 31st December 2019

- Bangladesh Power Development Board has the
right to operate the power plant or direct others to
operate the power plant in a manner it determines
while controlling entire output of the power plant

- It is impossible to for any other party other than
Bangladesh Power Development Board to take any
output of power generated by the power plant of
the company and the capacity charge per unit paid
by Bangladesh Power Development Board is not
based on the output.

The arrangement is accounted as a “Finance Lease”
under “SLFRS 16 - Leases where Raj Lnaka Company
Ltd and Lakdhanavi Bangala Power Ltd as the lessor
and Bangladesh Power Development Board as the
Lessee as all the risks and rewards incidental to
legal ownership of the power plant of the group are
transferred to Bangladesh Power Development Board.

Policy applicable before 1st January 2019

The arrangements, which transfer to the Board
substantially all the risks and benefits incidental
to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at
the inception of the lease at the fair value of the
leased property or, if lower , at the present value of
the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are
apportioned between the finance lease charges and
reduction of the leased liability so as to achieve a
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the Liability. Finance charges are charged and reflected
in the income statement.

Capitalized leased assets are depreciated over the
shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the
lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the
Board will obtain ownership by the end of the lease
term. The depreciation policy for depreciable leased
assets is consistent with that for depreciable asset that
are owned as described.

Operating lease payments are recognised as an
operating expense in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on
initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets
acquired in a business combination is their fair value as
at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition,
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if
any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding
capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and
expenditure is reflected in the statement of profit or
loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as
either finite or indefinite.

Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

Year Ended 31st December 2019

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised
over their useful economic lives and assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication that the
intangible assets may be impaired. The amortisation
period and the amortisation method for an intangible
asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the
end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of
future economic benefits embedded in the asset is
accounted for by changing the amortisation period or
method, as appropriate , and are treated as changes
in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense
on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss in the expense category
consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
amortised, but are tested for impairment annually,
either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually
to determine whether the indefinite life continues to
be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

Gain or losses arising from derecognition of an
intangible asset are measured as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the
carrying amount of the assets and are recognised
in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is
derecognised.

2.2.10 Financial Instruments - Initial Recognition and

Subsequent Measurement

2.2.10.1 Financial Assets

a) Initial Recognition and Measurement

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as
measured at: amortised cost; fair value through other
comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) -
equity investment; or fair value through profit or loss
(FVTPL).

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to
their initial recognition unless the Group changes
its business model for managing financial assets, in
which case all affected financial assets are reclassified
on the first day of the first reporting period following
the change in the business model.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it
meets both of the following conditions and is not
designated as at FVTPL:

- itis held within a business model whose objective is
to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

- its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets classified and measured at amortized
cost are limited to its trade debtors, loans to staff and
consumers, related party receivables, short term
investments and cash & cash equivalents.

A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated
asat FVTPL:

- itisheld within a business model whose objective is
achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows
and selling financial assets; and

- its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is
not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect
to present subsequent changes in the investment’s fair
value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-
by investment basis.

All financial assets not classified as measured at
amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are
measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative
financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may
irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise
meets the requirements to be measured at amortised
cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or
significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that
would otherwise arise.

Group’sinvestmentin equity investments are classified
as Fair Value through OCI.

Financial assets - Business model assessment

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of
the business model in which a financial asset is held at
a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the
business is managed and information is provided to
management. The information considered includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio
and the operation of those policies in practice.
These include whether management's strategy
focuses on earning contractual interest income,
maintaining a particular interest rate profile,
matching the duration of the financial assets to the
duration of any related liabilities or expected cash
outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of
the assets;

- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated
and reported to the Company's / Group's
management;

- therisks that affect the performance of the business
model (and the financial assets held within that
business model) and how those risks are managed;


- how managers of the business are compensated
- e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair
value of the assets managed or the contractual cash
flows collected; and

- the frequency, volume and timing of sales of
financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such
sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfers of financial assets to third parties in
transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are
not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with
the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.

Financial assets that are held for trading or are
managed and whose performance is evaluated on a
fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.

Financial assets -Assessment whether contractual
cash flows are solely payments of principal and
interest

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is
defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration
for the time value of money and for the credit risk
associated with the principal amount outstanding
during a particular period of time and for other
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and
administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows
are solely payments of principal and interest, the
Company / Group considers the contractual terms of
the instrument. This includes assessing whether the
financial asset contains a contractual term that could
change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows
such that it would not meet this condition. In making
this assessment, the Company / Group considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount
or timing of cash flows;

- terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate,
including variable-rate features;

- prepayment and extension features; and

- terms that limit the Company's / Group's claim to
cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse
features).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely
payments of principal and interest criterion if the
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid
amounts of principal and interest on the principal
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable
additional compensation for early termination of the
contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at
a discount or premium to its contractual par-amount,
a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an
amount that substantially represents the contractual

CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019      1  1 /

Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

Year Ended 31st December 2019

par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual
interest (which may also include reasonable additional
compensation for early termination) is treated
as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of
the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial
recognition.

b) Subsequent Measurement

The subsequent measurement of financial assets
depends on their classification as follows.

 

Financial assets | These assets are subsequently
atamortised         measured at amortised cost using
cost           the effective interest method.
The amortised cost is reduced
by impairment losses. Interest
income, foreign exchange gains
and losses and impairment are
recognised in profit or loss. Any
gain or loss on derecognition is
recognised in profit or loss.

 

Equity       These assets are subsequently
investments at | measured at fair value. Dividends
FVOCI      are recognised as income in

profit or loss unless the dividend
clearly represents a recovery of
part of the cost of the investment.
Other net gains and losses are
recognised in OCI and are never
reclassified to profit or loss.

 

 

 

 

c) Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable apart of a
financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial
assets) is derecognised when,

i) Therights to receive cash flows from the asset have
expired

ii) The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash
flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation
to pay the received cash flows in full without
material delay to a third party under a” pass -
through” arrangement; an either

(a) Group has transferred substantially all the
risks and rewards of the asset, or

(b) The Group has neither transferred nor
retained substantially or risks and rewards
of the asset, but as transferred control of the
asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive
cash flows from and asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, and has neither transferred
nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards
of the asset nor transferred control of it, the asset is
recognised to the extent of the company’s continuing

involvement in it. In that case, the Group also
recognises an associated liability. The transferred
assets and the associated liability are measured on a
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the
Group has retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a
guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at
the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset
and the maximum amount of consideration that the
Group could be required to repay.

2.2.10.1.1 Impairment of Financial Assets

The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether
there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or
a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset
or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired
if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment
as a result of one or more events that has occurred
after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred
‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the
group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that
the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing
significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency
in interest or principal payments, the probability
that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial
reorganisation and when observable data indicate that
there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future
cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic
conditions that correlate with defaults.

2.2.10.2 Financial Liabilities

a) Initial Recognition and Measurement

Financial Liabilities within the scope of LKAS 39
are classified as financial liabilities at fair value
through profit and loss, Loans and borrowings,
other financial liabilities or as derivatives
designated as hedging instruments in an effective
hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines
the classification of its financial liabilities at initial
recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised
initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings, and other financial liabilities carried at
amortised cost. This includes directly attributable
transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities
include trade & other payables, bank Overdrafts,
loans and borrowings, other financial liabilities.

b) Subsequent Measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends
on the classification as follows.

Loans and Borrowings

After initial recognition, interest bearing loans

and borrowings are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method. Gains are recognised in the statement of
profit or loss when the liabilities are recognised as
well as through the effective interest rate method
(EIR) amortisation process. Amortised cost is
calculated by taking into account any discount or
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are
an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is
included in finance cost in the statement of profit
or loss.

c) De-recognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the
obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial
liability is replaces by another from the same lender
on substantially different terms, or the terms of
an existing liability are substantially modified,
such an exchange or modification is treated as
a de-recognition of the original liability and the
recognition of a new liability, and the difference in
the respective carrying amounts is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss.

2.2.10.3 Offsetting of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and financial Liabilities are offset and
the net amount reported in the statement of financial
position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable
legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there
is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

2.2.10.4 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments that are traded
in active market at each reporting date is determined
by reference to quoted market prices or dealer
price quotations.(Bid price for long position and ask
price for short positions), without any deduction for
transaction costs. For financial instruments not traded
in an active market, the fair value is determined using
appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques
may include using recent arm's length market
transactions: reference to the current fair value of
another instrument that is substantially the same:
a discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation
models.

2.2.10.5 Impairment of Non - Financial Assets

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether
there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If
any such indication exists, or when annual impairment
testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates of
the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating
unit's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use
and is determined for an individual asset, unless


CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019      1  1 9

Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

Year Ended 31st December 2019

the asset does not generate cash inflows that are
largely independent of those from other assets or
Groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset
is considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessment of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset.

Impairment losses of continuing operations are
recognised in the statement of profit or loss in those
expense categories consistent with the function of
the impaired asset, except for property previously
revalued where the revaluation was taken to other
comprehensive income. In this case the impairment is
also recognised in other comprehensive income up to
the amount of any previous revaluation.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at the
reporting date and when circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is
determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable
amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the
goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the
CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment
loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to
goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.

A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed
only if there has been a change in the estimates used
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the
last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is
limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does
not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined,
net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is
recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the
assets are carried at a revalued amount, in which case
the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

2.2.11 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a
present obligations (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic, benefits will be
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where
the Group expects some or all of a provision to be
reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract,
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate
asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually
certain. The expense relating to any provision is
presented in the statement of profit or loss net of any
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money
is material, provisions are determined by discounting
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that

reflects current market assessments of the time value
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to
the liability, Where discounting is used, the increase in
the provision due to the passage of time is recognised
as finance cost.

2.2.12 Retirement Benefit Obligations

a) Defined Benefit Plan — Gratuity

Defined benefit plan- gratuity defines an amount of
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement,
usually dependent on one or more factors such
as years of service and remuneration. The define
benefit plan comprises the gratuity provided under
the Act, No.12 of 1983.

The Group measures the present value of the
promised retirement benefits for gratuity, which
is a defined benefit plan using actuarial valuation
technique which is based on the Projected Unit
Credit method (PUC). Actuarial gains and losses
are recognized in full in the period in which they
occur in the statement of profit or loss. The gratuity
liability is not externally funded. This item is
grouped under other Defined Benefit Liabilities in
the Balance Sheet.

b) Defined Benefit Plan - Pension Obligation

Define benefit plans define an amount of pension
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement,
usually dependent on one or more factors such as
years of service and remuneration.

The liability recognised in the statement of financial
position in respect of defined benefit pension plan
isthe presentvalue of the defined benefit obligation
at the end of the reporting period less the fair
value of plan assets, together with adjustments
for unrecognised past -service cost. The defined
benefit obligation is calculated annually by
independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined
benefit obligation is determined by discounting
the estimated future cash out flows using interest
rates of government bonds in the absence of high
quality deep corporate bond market in Sri Lanka.
The government bonds are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that
have to maturity approximating to the terms of the
related pension obligation.

Actuarial gain and losses arising from experience
adjustment and charges in actuarial assumption
are charged or credited to equity in other
comprehensive income in the period in which they
arise.

Past service cost are recognised immediately in
the statement of comprehensive income, unless

the changes to the pension plan are conditional on
the employees remaining in service for a specified
period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the
past service cost are amortised on a straight line
basis over the vesting period.

c) Defined Contribution Plans - Employees’
Provident Fund & Employees’ Trust Fund

Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident
Fund Contribution and Employees’ Trust Fund
Contributions in line with the respective Statutes
and Regulations. The Group contributes 12%
and 3% of gross emoluments of employees to
Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’
Trust Fund respectively except of the Ceylon
electricity Board where it contributes 15% of gross
emoluments of employees to Ceylon Electricity
Board Provident Fund.

2.2.13 Self Insurance Reserve

CEB transfers to a self Insurance Reserve each year, at
the rate of 0.1% of the gross re-valued fixed assets at
the end of the year. Losses and damages to Property,
Plant and Equipment of CEB are charged to this
Insurance reserve. The funds for this purpose are met
from the monies invested in a separate account at a
Bank.

2.2.14 Government Grants

Government grants are recognised initially at fair value
when there is reasonable assurance that they will be
received and the Group will comply with the conditions
associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the
Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the
Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive
Income as other income on a systematic basis in the
same periods in which the expenses are recognised.
Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an
assetarerecognised inthe profit or loss on a systematic
basis over the useful life of the asset.

2.2.15 Revenue from contracts with customers

The Group recognises revenue when it satisfies a
performance obligation by transferring a promised
good or service to the customer at the amount of
consideration to which the Group expects to be
entitled in exchange for transferring such goods
or services to a customer. Accordingly, the Group
recognizes Revenue as follows.

a) Sale of Electricity/Services and Goods

The Group recognizes the Revenue from Sale of
Electricity when the customers use the electricity
through the service connections provided. The
price at which the revenue is recognized will be
decided based on the tariff category and the rates
gazetted by the Public Utility Commission of Sri
Lanka.

b) Consumer Contribution

The consideration received from the customers
at the inception to create the asset facilitating
the provision of electricity over the period is
recognized as revenue over time, since the
customers simultaneously receive and consume
the benefit of the asset provided by the Group in
consuming electricity over the period. Hence, the
consideration received is recognized as revenue
over the useful life of the asset.

c) Electric Vehicle Charging Revenue

The electricity consumed by the customers who
charge their electric vehicles in the Electric Vehicle
Charging Stations established by the Board
through the use of prepaid e-cards provided for the
same are recognized as revenue once the electric
vehicles are charged.

d) Contract Liabilities

A contract liability is an obligation to transfer
services to a customer to whom the Group has
already received consideration. Hence, the
remaining prepaid balance in the e-card for electric
vehicle charging and the un-amortized balance in
the consumer contribution for service connections
are considered as contract liabilities of the Group.

e) Other Income and Gains
Interest

Interest income is recognised as the interest
accrues unless collectability is in doubt.

For all financial instruments measured at amortised
cost, interest income or expense is recorded using
the Effective Interest Rate (EIR), which is the rate
that exactly discounts the estimated future cash
payments or receipts through the expected life
of the financial instrument or a shorter period,
where appropriate, to the net carrying amount
of the financial asset or liability. Interest income
is included in finance income in the statement of
comprehensive income.

Dividends
Dividend income recognised when the
shareholders’ right to receive the payment is
established.

Others

Otherincomeis recognised onan accrual basis. Net
gains and losses of a revenue nature on the disposal
of property, plant & equipment and other non-
current assets including investments have been
accounted for in the Statement of profit or loss,
having deducted from proceeds on disposal, the

carrying amount of the assets and related selling
expenses. Gains and losses arising from incidental
activities to main revenue generating activities and
those arising from a Group of similar transactions
which are not material, are aggregated, reported
and presented on a net basis.

SIGNIFICANT ~~ ACCOUNTING
JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES

ASSUMPTIONS,

In the process of applying the Group accounting
policies, management is required to make judgment,
apart         from those involving estimations,
which has the most significant effect on the amounts
recognized in the Financial statements. Further
management is required to consider key assumptions
concerning the future and other key sources of
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that
have a significant risk of a using a material adjustments
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year are discussed below. The
respective carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
are given in related notes to the Financial Statements.
The key items as such are discussed below.

Leases

The determination of whether an arrangement is,
or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the
arrangement at inception date, whether fulfilment
of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a
specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys
a right to use asset, even if that right is not explicitly
specified in an arrangement. Accordingly the thermal
power plants in which the Group does not transfer
substantially all the risk and benefits of owner ship of
the assets are classified as operating lease. The Group
exercised significant judgment in determining criteria
that individually or combination would lead to lease
being classified as a finance lease or operating lease.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

When the fair value of financial assets and financial
liabilities recorded in the statement of financial
position cannot be from active markets, their fair value
is determined using valuation techniques including
the discounted cash flow mode. The inputs to these
models are taken from observable markets where
possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of
judgment is required in establishing fair values. The
judgments include considerations of inputs such as
liquidity risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions
about these factors could affect the reported fair value
of financial instruments.

Reviews of Impairment Losses on non financial assets
The Group determines whether assets have been
impaired by performing an impairment review. This
requires the estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the cash
generating units. Estimating value in use requires
management to make an estimate of the expected

future cash flows from the cash generating unit
and also to select a suitable discount rate in order to
calculate the present value of the relevant cash flows.
This valuation requires the Group to make estimates
about expected future cash flows and discount rates,
and hence, they are subject to uncertainty.

Impairment Losses on Trade and Other Receivables
Trade and other receivables that have been assessed
individually and found not to be impaired and all
individually insignificant receivables are then assessed
collectively, in Groups of assets with similar risk
characteristics, to determine whether provision should
be made due to incurred loss events for which there is
objective evidence, but the effects of which are not
yet evident. The collective assessment takes account
of data from the receivable portfolio (such as levels
of arrears, credit utilisation, etc.), and judgments on
the effect of concentrations of risk and economic data
(including levels of unemployment, real estate prices
indies, country risk and the performance of different
individual Groups).

Taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes and other taxes
including VAT. Significant judgment was required to
determine the total provision for current, deferred
and other taxes pending the issue of tax guidelines on
the treatment of the adoption of SLFRS in the financial
statements and taxable profit for the purpose of
imposition of taxes. Uncertainties exist, with respect to
the interpretation of the applicability of tax laws, at the
time of the preparation of this Financial Statements.
The Group recognised assets and liabilities for
current, deferred and other taxes on estimates of
whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final
tax outcome of these matters is different from the
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences
will impact the income, deferred and tax amounts in
the period in which the determination is made.

Useful lives of Property, Plant & Equipment

The Group reviews the assets’ residual values, useful
lives and methods of depreciation at each reporting
date. Judgment by the management is exercised in the
estimation of these values, rate, and methods.

Defined Benefit Plans-Gratuity

The cost of defined benefit plans- gratuity is
determined using actuarial valuation technique.
The actuarial valuation technique involves making
assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of
return on assets, future salary increases. Due to the
long term nature of these plans, such estimates are
subject to significant uncertainty.

EVENTS OCCURING AFTER THE STATEMENT OF THE FINANCIAL POSITION

COIVD - 19 impact on the group

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 started towards latter part of year 2019 has severely impacted many local economies around
the globe. In many countries, businesses are being forced to cease or limit operations for long period of time. Measures taken
to curtail the spread of the virus, including travel bans, quarantines, social distancing and closure of non-essential services have
triggered significant disruption to businesses worldwide, resulting in an economic slowdown.

The below summaries the financial impact to the Board and the group on COVID - 19.

The Board

The provision of electricity being an essential service, continued to carry out its main operation of generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity throughout the country even during the period affected. However, the Imposition of island wide curfew
since mid March 2020 increased the electricity demand from the domestic sector whereas it adversely affected the demand from
General Purpose, Industrial and Hotel sectors. Hence, a drop in revenue was noted from March to May 2020 when compared with
the same period in year 2019.

Low disposable income of the customers coupled with government decisions to provide a grace period to settle the bills and to
defer the disconnection of unpaid customers has a great impact on already-hindered cash-flows of the Board. In order to mitigate
the cash-flow related challenges, the Board of Directors decided to limit the capital nature expenditure only to essentials and to
delay the settlement of the suppliers. Hence, Board had to borrow funds to maintain the uninterrupted power supply.

The Group

Recent COVID 19 containing measures taken by the home country Government has caused temporal disruption to business
operations ofthe companies ofthe LTLgroup based inthe home country and their customers. Disruption mainly affected the business
of subsidiary companies, which carry out manufacturing activities. Group’s Indian manufacturing entity has also encountered a
similar situation. However, the companies of the LTL group that carry out Operation Maintenance activities supporting the power
generation business are continuing their operations as an essential service, despite delay in recovery of their debtors.

In addition to the above, resulting effects of the above mentioned activities and situations would trigger negative consequences
and the resultant financial repercussions would be felt by the Group starting from the first quarter of 2020 and would continue for a
considerable period from there onwards.

Fair Value through OCI Financial asset (Investment in West Coast Power Private Limited) as at 31 December 2019 was recognized
based on range of economic conditions such as weighted average cost of capital, Inflation rate and Exchange rates. Given the impact
of COVID-19 is still evolving, the appropriateness of such assumptions and any impact thereto cannot be reasonably determined.

The Group companies will continue to take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential impact and will keep its contingency and
risk management measures under review, as the situation evolves.

The group has determined that these events are non adjusting subsequent events. Accordingly, the financial position and results of
operations as of and for the year ended 31 December 2019 have not been adjusted to reflect the impact. Given the conditions and
the spread of the corona virus is still evolving, the impact to Group's financial results cannot be reasonably estimated at the date of
authorizing these financial statements.

CONTINGENCIES
The Board
The contingent liability arising with regard to the litigation matters pending in the labour tribunal and other Courts including Court

of appeal and Supreme Courts as at 31.12.2019, the CEB is defendant respondent. The contingent liability in the unlikely event that
all these cases are adversely decided is estimated at Rs.4,340Mn.

Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

38.3 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will causes a financial loss for the other party by failing to
discharge an obligation.

The credit policy of Ceylon Electricity Board and Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt) Ltd is as follows:

For bulk consumers 15 days credit period is allowed to settle the bills and thereafter, a disconnection notice will be issued
and further 10 days granted from the day of notice, if not acceded to this supply will be disconnected.

Ordinary consumers will be given 30 days credit period to settle the bill. Subsequent to this a red notice will be issued and
further 10 days given after 40 days if not acceded to this a disconnection order will be issued for the disconnection of supply.

Individual characteristics of each customer is considered by analysing the credit worthiness before granting the credit
facility. And the group has implemented an effective credit control process, whereby age wise analysis of outstanding
debtors are carried -out for effective control and timely recovery.

38.4 Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk of the group arises from having insufficient cash resources to meet its obligations as they arise. Insufficient
liquidity resources could have an adverse impact on the group’s operations while impairing investor, customer, and supplier
confidence thereby weakening its competitive position

The group has implemented a strategic working capital management plan across all sectors whereby the receivables are
closely monitored and debtors’ period is minimized. Careful vendor evaluations and procurement strategies ensure that
correct prices are paid for inputs and maximum credit periods are negotiated to optimize the working capital cycle.

The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium term financial instruments to support operational
and other funding requirements. The short term liquidity problems are mitigated through negotiation with the bank to
increase the overdraft limits at concessionary interest rates.

38.5 Market risk
‘Market risk” is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
market prices. Market risk comprises Currency risk and Interest rate risk. The financial instruments affected by the market
risk includes loans & borrowings, deposits an available for sale investments.

38.5.1 Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales / purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective
functional currencies of Group entities. The currency in which these transactions primarily are denominated in U.S. Dollars or
Euro currencies. The currency risk is minimized by the Group by internally hedging against any exchange rate transactions,
over time. Amount equivalent to future payments are placed in short term income generating instruments for appropriate
currencies such that the same is utilized for payments as and when they fall due.

38.5.2 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the
Group's long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group manages interest rate risk on its borrowings by
maintaining a mix of fixed rate and floating rate facilities as well as maintaining deposits, which would cover against market
fluctuations. Ceylon Electricity Board, being a government organization negotiates with the bank for favourable interest
rates to minimise the exposure in interest rates.

39 FAIRVALUE
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

a) The Management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other
current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

b) Long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest
rates, specific risk factors, individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the financed
project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected losses of these receivables. As
at December 31, 2019, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, were not materially different from
their calculated fair values.

39.1 Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value

39.3 Fair value hierarchy
For all financial instruments where fair values are determined by referring to externally quoted prices or observable pricing
inputs to models, independent price determination or validation is obtained. In an active market, direct observation of
a trade price may not be possible. In these circumstances, the group use alternative market information to validate the
financial instrument's fair value, with greater weight given to information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable.

Fair value are determined according to the following hierarchy.

Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2 : Other valuation techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are
observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Valuation techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on
observable market data.

Description of significant unobservable inputs to valuation of FVOCI - Financial assets
Lank Electricity Company (Pvt) Ltd

Fair value of unquoted equity investments has been estimated using Market Multiple Methodology (MMM). Under MMM
approach value is estimated based on suitable levels of future earnings for a business (“maintainable earnings”) and applies
an appropriate multiple to these earnings, capitalizing them into a value for the business. Company applies EBIT as earning
base. To identify appropriate peers to use in reviewing the fair value of West Coast Power (Private) Ltd , listed companies
involved in the supply of electricity using fossil fuel in the Asian Region were analysed. Outliers were estimated based on the
differences in the nature of operations and size of the entities.

Due to the minority stake of West Coast Power (Private) Limited, the Management is not in a position to access the direct
management and insider information. However considering the nature of the industry and general features of Power
Purchasing agreement, market values of assets and liabilities are assumed to be remain similar to the carrying value recorded
as at December 31, 2019.

LTL Holdings (Pvt) Ltd

Thefairvalue ofthe unquoted ordinary shares have been estimated using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. The valuation
requires management to make certain assumptions about the model inputs, including forecast cash flows and discount
rate. The probabilities of the various estimates within the range can be reasonably assessed and used in management's
estimate of fair value for the unquoted equity investment

Qualified Opinion

The audit of the consolidated financial statements of the “Ceylon Electricity Board” (the CEB) and its Subsidiaries (“the
Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2019 comprising the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019
and the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then
ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of accounting policies, was carried out
under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article 154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic
of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with provisions of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018 and Finance Act No. 38 of 1971.
My comments and observations which | consider should be published with the annual report of the Board in terms
of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, appear in this report. My report, to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in
Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due course. The financial statements of LTL Holdings (Private) Ltd was
audited by the firms of Chartered Accountants in public practice appointed by the Board of Directors of the Subsidiary.

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my report,
the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Group as at 31
December 2019, and of their financial performance and the cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri
Lanka Accounting Standards.

Basis for Qualified Opinion
Comments on Consolidated Financial Statements

The auditor of the Trincomalee Power Company Limited (TPCL) has emphasized the following matter on its financial
statements.

The company, which operated with the sole purpose of developing a 500 MW Coal Power Plant in Sampur has ceased
the development activities of that Power Plant and the expenses previously capitalized has been written off in the year
2018. Instead, Cabinet approval has been received to setup a 50 MW Solar Power Plant by TPCL on the same land
provided to construct the Coal Power Plant in Sampur. Further, Cabinet approval has also been granted to develop a
500 MW LNG Power Plant at Kerawalapitiya. However, any improvement in respect of the development activities of the
above power plants had not been carried-out even as at the end of year under review. Accordingly, this indicates the
existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern.

The Qualified Opinions on the financial statements of the following companies for the year ended 31 December 2019
had been expressed by me based on the following observations.

As per paragraph 51 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard on Property, Plant & Equipment (LKAS 16), the
useful life of the asset shall be reviewed at least at each financial year end and if expectations differ from
previous estimates, the changes shall be accounted in accordance with LKAS 08. However, useful life of the
fully depreciated motor vehicles still in use had not been reviewed and accounted accordingly.

As per paragraph 88 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard on Income Tax (LKAS 12), no disclosure had been
made regarding the assessment of Rs. 159,549,619 relating to the Economic Service Charge (ESC) for the year
of assessment 2017/2018 and the penalties imposed of amounting to Rs.75,461,644 thereon in the financial
statements of the year under review. Further, total ESC payable as at the end of the year under review was Rs.
579,179,232. As per section 6 of the Economic Service Charge Act No 13 of 2006 duly amended, ESC liability
should be paid on or before twentieth day of following month after quarter ending. However, the Company
had not paid ESC payable even up to the date of this report.

As per paragraph 14 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard on Revenue (LKAS 18), revenue from the sale of
goods had not been recognized. When importation of coal, a mark-up of 10 per cent added to the value at
the point of Customs as a notional adjustment in ascertaining the value for the custom purpose. However,
the Company had been added notional 10 per cent mark-up amounting to Rs. 3,804,035,310 to the revenue
and later the Company had given such amount as discount to the debtors and charged to the cost of sale. As
a result, the cost of sales and revenue had been overstated by similar amount and additional ESC had to be
paid thereon.

A forfeiture (penalty) of Rs. 205,000,000 had been imposed to the Company by Sri Lanka Customs on non-
declaration of correct transaction value of the coal imported during 19 September 2016 to 09 April 2018.
The Company had debited this penalty payment to the Sri Lanka Custom VAT account amounting to Rs.
155, 426,118, VAT control account amounting to Rs. 39,970,418 and CSCL liability account amounting to
Rs. 9,603,464 erroneously. As a result, the expenses had been understated by Rs. 205,000,000 and assets
had been overstated by Rs. 195,396,536 and liabilities had been understated by Rs. 9,603,464. Further, the
Company had recorded a sum of Rs. 126,956,898 as receivable from CEB and payable of Custom VAT in
relating to VAT in the ledger. However, supporting documents and clear reasons were not given to verify this
value.

The Company had used the funds, which received from Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for settlement of
shipment bills, to pay penalty mention in part iv even without obtained board approval and had not been
done a formal investigation to identify the persons who are responsible for the losses.

The Company had not taken necessary actions to recover the receivable balance amounting to Rs.
539,192,079 from Taurian Iron and Steel Company Ltd (TISCL) through Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd
(CSCL) with regard to short delivery of coal. TISCL/CSCL had not confirmed this balance and no provision had
been made for impairment, even though the receivable balance outstanding over seven years.

Brought forwarded Economic Service Charges (ESC) receivable amounting to Rs. 894,151, Withholding
Tax (WHT) receivable amounting to Rs. 77,719, Income Tax payable amounting to Rs. 65,474,540, Nation
Building Tax (NBT) receivable amounting to Rs. 3,371,326 and Value Added Tax (VAT) receivable amounting
to Rs. 12,758,801 which could not be verified in previous year audit been charged against retained earnings
in 2018 as prior year adjustment. The Company had failed to correct these adjustments even as at the end of
the year under review.

A sum of Rs. 15,870,104 payable to Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd (CSCL) in respect of lightering VAT
(Shipment number 151 to 154) which was paid by CEB had been neither paid to CSCL nor presented as an
advance received from CEB. Further, the Company had not accounted the aforesaid lightering VAT as payable
to CSCL though they have obtained the fund from CEB to settle the charge.

VAT payable on reimbursement expenses amounting to Rs. 8,280,994 had not been accounted in the VAT
control account. As a result, VAT liability had been understated by the similar amount.

The Company had paid a sum of Rs. 4,000,000 to supplier through Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd (CSCL)
without a liability in the ledger account as payable to the said supplier or payable to CSCL in this regard.
However, the Company had deducted this amount from CSCL payable balance erroneously. Hence, the
liabilities had been understated by similar amount.

The Company had paid a sum of Rs. 136,236,370 as Custom VAT for the Shipment No.123 though actual VAT
amount was Rs. 106,969,404 as per to the Cusdec. Hence, the overpaid VAT amount was Rs. 29,266,965 and
in the financial statement it was shown as VAT receivable amounting to Rs.26,507,084. Hence, a difference of
Rs. 2,759,882 between two balances were observed in audit.

The Company had debited asum ofRs. 5,218,271 to CSCL payable account. However, supporting documents
and reasons were not given to verify this amount. Further, the Company had not reconciled the difference of
Rs. 31,916,562 between the balances of Lanka Coal Company (Pvt) Ltd and CSCL disbursement account.

Penalties on Economic Service Charge (ESC) amounting to Rs. 500,546 , Nation Building Tax (NBT)

- SLFRS 15 paragraph 01

- LKAS 01 paragraph 79,113,117
- LKAS 02 paragraph 37

- LKAS 12 paragraph 80(a)

- LKAS 19 paragraph 57,140,141
- LKAS 24 paragraph 17

- LKAS 38 paragraph 118 (a,b)

Section 2(2) of Economic Service Charge Act, No. 13 of 2006 (as amended), an entity turnover has exceeded
12.5 Million per quarter (threshold per quarter) and liable for Economic Service charges. Turnover of the
Company was Rs.396 Million (total turnover). However, the Company had not paid Economic Service
Charges for year 2019 and hence ESC liability has been understated by Rs. 1,983,064.

Staff of the Company had done administrative works of the subsidiaries also without charging any
management fee. Hence Group's staff expenses amounting to Rs. 24,847,325 had been charged to the
Company erroneously.

1.2.2    Comments on Financial Statement of the CEB

1.2.2.1 Compliance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLAS/SLFRS) and Accounting Policies.

The following observations are made.

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

LKAS 1- Presentation of Financial Statements

(i) The Board had off set the balance of Rs. 30,609,836 of sundry debtors against the creditors in relation to the
POS counter payment and Post office commission. As a result sundry debtors and creditors balance had been
understated by same amount.

(ii) The loan disbursed amount of Rs.1,262,503,405 to Green Power Development and energy efficiency
improvement project had been shown as disbursement of Wind power project in the Note no. 24.2.1.

(iii) Rs. 25 million paid as loan processing fee for Rs. 83 billion loans obtained had been presented as other
expense under administration expenses instead of presenting as finance cost.

LKAS 2- Inventories and LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment

The CEB is applying the standard cost method for valuing of labour, material and overhead costs of its capital and
maintenance jobs, instead of applying the actual costs as per the provisions in the above Standards. As a result, the
favourable material price variance and labour and overhead rate variances aggregating to Rs. 6,409,494,526,"and
unfavourable stores price variance of Rs. 2,428,128,229 arisen thereon had been brought to the financial
statements.

As aresult of that, the operating results, assets, liabilities and equity of the CEB have been significantly affected due
to high financial involvement in relation to the capital jobs. However, the impact to the financial statements thereon
could not be ascertained in audit due to non-availability of required information relating to those capital jobs.

LKAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

The useful lifetime of fully depreciated non-current assets which are being continuously utilized by the CEB had
not been reviewed as mentioned in the accounting policies. For instance, fully depreciated four power stations and
1,683 numbers motor vehicles costing Rs. 32,241,176,427 and Rs.3,918,235,311 respectively are being still using
without estimating the real life time.

LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment
The fixed assets amounting to Rs. 172,019,335,924 in the Transmission Division had not been physically verified
during the year under review.

1.2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies

(a)

(b)

A debit balance of Rs. 3,535,799,151 (stock shortage) and a credit balance of Rs. 90,343,073 (stock excess) had
remained in the Stock Adjustment Account for more than one year without being cleared.

As per the decision No. 10/2 434/423/034 of the Cabinet of Ministers, the CEB should repay the loan and interest
thereon to the General Treasury for the loan amount of Rs. 159,184,187,965 obtained for the construction of
Lakwijaya Power Plant. However, the CEB had not paid or made provisions in its accounts for the above payments
although the Department of External Resources of the General Treasury had paid an amount of Rs.25,247,801,891
up to 31 December 2018 as interest for the said loan to the lending bank. As a result of non-provision of interest,
retained earnings as at 31 December 2019 had been overstated by Rs. 25,247,801,891.

The jobs carried out by the CEB for supply, maintain and repair of power generators, lifts and air conditioners of the
government institutions prior to the year 2013 had been valued at cost and accounted them accordingly instead
of account the jobs based on their invoice values. As a result, the receivables and retained earnings shown in the
financial statements had been understated by Rs. 66,987,761.

The amount of Rs.500 million out of Rs.5 billion which was paid to the General treasury as levy in the year 2016
had been amortised to the income statement by classifying as payment of management fee during the year
under review and prior year adjustment had been made for Rs. 1 billion. The balance amount of Rs. 3.5 billion is

management services had been obtained by the CEB from the General treasury. Therefore loss for the year had
been overstated by Rs.500 million.

from the books of accounts during the year under review. Hence loss for the year had been understated by same
amount.

The amount of Rs. 944,030,864 of work in progress relating to the Upper Kothmale Hydro Power project which was
completed in 2012 had not been transferred to the fixed assets. Hence depreciation for the year under review and

The amount of Rs. 603,573,159 of work in progress relating to the Puttalam Coal Power project which was
completed in 2014 had not been transferred to the fixed assets. Hence depreciation for the year under review and
retained earnings had been understated by Rs. 20,119,105 and Rs. 100,595,526 respectively.

| conducted my audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). My responsibilities, under those
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
section of my report. | believe that the audit evidence | have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
my qualified opinion.

1.3          Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is necessary
to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless management either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018, the Group is required to maintain proper books and
records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic consolidated financial
statements to be prepared of the Group.

1.4          Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sri
Lanka Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, | exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. | also:

+ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is

resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If | conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, | am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
to cease to continue as a going concern.

Comments on Consolidated Financial Statements

The auditor of the Trincomalee Power Company Limited (TPCL) has emphasized the following matter on its financial
statements.

Since Cabinet approval was granted to develop 50 MW Solar Power and 500 MW LNG power plants, TPCL has decided
to use the land allocated for coal power plant at Sampur for 50 MW solar project. The said matter was continuously
discussed in the Board Meetings of TPCL held during the past periods and now the Board has decided to amend
the articles of association of TPCL in order to implement the solar power project in TPCL. The board of TPCL will take
necessary actions to sign joint venture agreement between CEB and National Thermal Power Company Ltd (NTPC),
India during 2020 in order to commence the solar project. However required legal clearance should be obtained from
Attorney General before signing the JV agreement.

After series of discussions between CEB and NTPC now both parties have signed joint venture agreement on 25th
October 2019 for the development of the LNG power plant at Kerawalapitiya.

Progress of discussions are on hold as of today due to impact of COVID 19. However the Board of TPCL is in the opinion
that steps will be taken to implement the proposed projects during future periods.

The Qualified Opinions on the financial statements of the following companies for the year ended 31 December
2019 had been expressed by me based on the following observations.

(a) Lanka Coal Company (Pvt.) Ltd (LCC)

i.  Asper paragraph 51 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard on Property, Plant & Equipment (LKAS 16), the useful
life of the asset shall be reviewed at least at each financial year end and if expectations differ from previous
estimates, the changes shall be accounted in accordance with LKAS 08.

A certified valuation for all fully depreciated 3 vehicles belongs to LCC will be obtained and pass the necessary
adjustment during the financial year 2020.

ii. As per paragraph 88 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard on Income Tax (LKAS 12), no disclosure had been
made regarding the assessment of Rs. 159,549,619 relating to the Economic Service Charge (ESC) for the year
of assessment 2017/2018 and the penalties imposed of amounting to Rs.75,461,644 thereon

A letter was sent to the Department of Inland Revenue requesting for an extension of the settlement of ESC and a
request was also made to refrain from any recovery action or imposition of any levies against the company in this
regard until an amicable agreement is made on the settlement of the ESC.

iii. As per paragraph 14 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard on Revenue (SLFRS 15), revenue from the sale of
goods had not been recognized.

LCC was given a directive by Inland Revenue Department (IRD) to add the customs margin to cost in the issuance
of VAT invoices to CEB. This pricing mechanism was adopted following a meeting held in the ministry on 28th June,
2018 with the attendance of an official from Inland Revenue Department (IRD). IRD official is on record and minuted
having told that LCC's base value for VAT on invoices to CEB cannot be less than the value for customs purposes.
The 10% is, therefore, added solely on the directive of IR official. Since then CEB has challenged the directive and
written to IR by their letter dated 2018-09-07 to which the response is yet to be received. Until such time we added
10% customs margin to invoice but do not remit any excess output VAT to IRD in the interim pending issuance of a
ruling by IRD. Hence it is the reason for the apparent overstatement of revenue.

A forfeiture (penalty) of Rs. 205,000,000 had been imposed to the Company by Sri Lanka Customs on non-
declaration of correct transaction value of the coal imported during 19 September 2016 to 09 April 2018.

As per the investigation done by Sri Lanka Customs, Lanka Coal Company has not declared the correct transaction
values of the coal imported during the period from 19/09/2016 to 09/04/2018. During that time the custom
declaration totally handled by Ceylon Shipping Corporation (CSC) for a charge of Rs.1,000,000/- per shipment.
S.L Customs had imposed a forfeiture of 205,000,000/- to LCC on above wrong declaration & the investigation
officers of S.L Customs had informed to LCC Officers that no any final VAT payment to be done after this payment.

LCC had already paid Rs37,594,744 as VAT to the relevant shipments earlier and was compelled to settle the sum of
Rs 205Mn subsequently using the funds provided by CEB since S.L. Customs held the clearance of coal shipments.

However, LCC has written this matter to Finance Minister through the line Ministry requesting to waive off the
said forfeiture which was rejected. But this matter is under investigation by a special committee (Nemmawatta
Committee) appointed by two secretaries of the ministries relating to CEB & CSC and awaiting their report to make
the correct presentation in the financial statements.

The Company had used the funds, which received from Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for settlement of
shipment bills, to pay penalty mention in part iv

LCC had done the payment using the given funds by CEB since S.L. Customs hold the clearance of coal shipments.
This matter is under investigation by a special committee (Nemmawatta Committee) appointed by two secretaries
of Ministries relating to CEB & CSC and awaiting their report

The Company had not taken necessary actions to recover the receivable balance amounting to Rs.539,192,079
from Taurian Iron and Steel Company Ltd (TISCL) through Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd (CSCL) with regard
to short delivery of coal.

Taurian Iron and Steel settlement was handled by a high level committee. The committee has not opined that the
debt is bad and even the buyer has consented to settle the dues by supplying coal. According to information in
our possession, the settlement proposal has been submitted for determination by the cabinet. Present Status
of Outstanding amount receivable from Ceylon Shipping Corporation (Taurian Iron and Steel Company Ltd.)
was referred to the Cabinet of Ministers and the Cabinet appointed a four-members Committee of the Treasury
(Chairman), Ceylon Shipping Corporation, Lakvijaya Power Plant and Lanka Coal Company to negotiate with the
Taurian Iron and Steel Company. Further, Cabinet has advised to submit the recommendations of the committee
through Ministry of Ports and Shipping back to the Cabinet which is yet to be submitted

2018 as prior year adjustment

ESC/WHT

Irrecoverable ESC and WHT totaling Rs.971,868 formed part of the approval received from the Board to write off
long outstanding unsubstantiated tax balances.

Income Tax

The Inland Revenue Department confirmed in writing that the outstanding income taxes were only Rs.2,049,484
and Rs.3,590,678 for the years 14/15 and 13/14 respectively. Therefore, tax payable of Rs. 11,703,151 which was
no longer necessary was adjusted with the approval of the Board of Directors at the meeting held on 26/07/2018.

There was a further extra provision of Rs.65,474,540 for income tax. This too was no longer necessary according to
written confirmation of Income Tax liability from IR referred to above. Therefore, the excess provision was reversed
with the permission of the Board leaving out the payable as per written confirmation from IR.

NBT

NBT is paid by the company in the past had been accounted for as a receivable and stood at Rs.3,371,326 at the
end of 2017. LCC being an importer and trader of coal is not entitled to claim refund of NBT paid. Therefore, Board
permission was obtained at the meeting held on 26/07/2018 to adjust the above balance from the balance sheet.

VAT

Input VAT which has been accounted for as a receivable of Rs. 12,758,801 at the end of 2017 was adjusted to reflect
the correct position. We wrote to the IR department inquiring to the possibility of receiving a refund of input VAT. IR
department by their letter dated 14/06/2018 explained that in terms of section 22(5) of VAT Act No. 14 of 2002 the
input VAT paid by the company shall not be refunded. Accordingly, having obtained the Board permission at the
meeting held on 26/07/2018 the above receivable amount was adjusted.

A sum of Rs. 15,870,104 payable to Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd (CSCL) in respect of lightering VAT
(Shipment number 151 to 154) which was paid by CEB had been neither paid to CSCL nor presented as an
advance received from CEB.

LCC did not pay the VAT on lightering charges Rs.15,870,104.32 from shipment no 151 to 154 to CSC because
Inland Revenue Department issued a ruling making lightering liable for VAT @ 0%. This receipt was utilized to make
the settlement of final VAT assessment for the 11 shipments from shipment no 124 to 142. A credit note has been
issued on this regard in year 2020.

VAT payable on reimbursement expenses amounting to Rs.8,280,994 had not been accounted in the VAT
control account. As a result, VAT liability had been understated by the similar amount.

As per audit query itself these are re-imbursement for which LCC possess bills. There is no any margin added for our
services. As advised by our Tax consultant, re-imbursement of expenses is not liable for VAT.

The Company had paid a sum of Rs.4,000,000 to supplier through Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd (CSC)
without a liability in the ledger account as payable to the said supplier or payable to CSCL in this regard.

The nature of the balance will be investigated and corrected accordingly in future

The Company had paid a sum of Rs.136,236,370 as Custom VAT for the Shipment No.123 though actual VAT
amount was Rs.106,969,404 as per to the Cusdec.

The balance was rectified during the financial year 2020.

The Company had debited a sum of Rs. 5,218,271 to CSC payable account. However, supporting documents

Rs. 10,134,113 and Value Added Tax (VAT) amounting to Rs.1,900,938 have been imposed by the Department

Negotiations were made with the Inland Revenue Department to waive off the penalties hence, the necessary
disclosures will be made in the financial statements of year 2020

(b) Srilanka Energies (Pvt) Ltd

Non-compliances in relation to the Sri Lanka accounting standards were observed.

The necessary arrangements will be made to adhere to these best practices according to the Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards from 2020 onwards

Section 2(2) of Economic Service Charge Act, No. 13 of 2006 (as amended), an entity turnover has exceeded
12.5 Million per quarter (threshold per quarter) and liable for Economic Service charges.

Sri Lanka Energies (Pvt) Ltd will comply as required in future.

Staff of the Company had done administrative works of the subsidiaries also without charging any management
fee. Hence Group's staff expenses amounting to Rs.24,847,325 had been charged to the Company erroneously.

Since the subsidiaries have not been generating adequate surplus during the year and the principle of charging
management fees have not been effected and be adhered to from financial year 2020 onwards.

(b) LKAS 2-Inventories and LKAS 16 -Property, Plant and Equipment

(c)

(d)

The CEB is applying the standard cost method for valuing of labour, material and overhead costs.

As per LKSA 2 paragraph 21 standard cost method for the measurement of inventories are recommended.
Accordingly, CEB uses standard prices for valuing of stocks, WIP and Property plant and Equipment due to the
practical difficulty of using actual costs. The committee formed to determine the standard prices of inventory work
hard on to ascertain precise and reasonable estimation that very close to actual prices of the inventory. However
due to complexity of technicality and huge volume of inventory, there is a gap between actual and standard prices.
This matter would be resolved once the integrated accounting system is introduced.

CEB has initiated the following actions to minimize gap between standard prices and actual prices.

® labour rate variance of DD4 and DD 3 has been eliminated from financial accounts of year 2019. Other two
divisions will be able to do the same in year 2020.

eo With the adaptation of the weighted average method for inventory valuation as recommended by the
committee which is appointed for, will be able to eliminate the impact of the material price variances to the
Financial Statements. Since this is being addressed in the ongoing ERP system, this issue will be solved once
the ERP system is in place.

eo Other than the Distribution assets which are transferred from WIP all other Property plant and Equipment
(Land, Building, Motor Vehicle, Machinery, and Office Equipment) are valued at actual cost which complies
with the recommendations of LKASs.

LKAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors
The useful lifetime of fully depreciated non-current assets which are being continuously utilized by the CEB
(i) Fully depreciated 1,683 numbers motor vehicles costing Rs. 3,918,235,311

The data has been collected from the Divisions regarding the useful life of the motor vehicles and the analysis
isin progress. A revised useful life could be recommended to record in the financial statements for year 2020

(ii) Fully depreciated four power stations Rs.32,241,176,427

The Generation Division power plants are unique and complex in nature. The economic life span of the
generators derived based on the Original Manufacturer's recommendation. A Committee will be appointed
to revisit the economic life span of the power plants. As CEB has well maintained the power plants and
Generators are operated beyond the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)’s expected life span.

LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment
The fixed assets amounting to Rs.172,019,335,924 in the Transmission Division had not been physically verified.

1.2.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies

(a)

(b)

A debit balance of Rs.3,535,799,151 (stock shortage) and a credit balance of Rs.90,343,073 (stock excess) had
remained in the Stock Adjustment Account for more than one year.

Actions have been taken by the respective divisions to pass necessary book entries where possible in 2020 and the
rest of shortage balances would be cleared upon completion of legal actions.

AsperthedecisionNo. 10/2434/423/034 ofthe Cabinet of Ministers, the CEB should repay the loan and interest
thereon to the General Treasury for the loan amount of Rs.159,184,187,965 obtained for the construction of
Lakwijaya Power Plant.

The repayment up to year 2018 had been absorbed by the General Treasury by considering materiality of liquidity
position of CEB. However as per the direction by Director General Public Enterprises Department, payment of the
interest amounting Rs. 3,556,442,931.30 made by the Treasury for the period of 2019 had been adjusted in the
books of CEB. Further, noted that adjustments will have to be made from year 2020 onwards subject to direction
from Public Enterprise Department.

The amount of Rs.3,556,442,931 recorded to the equity on 17 October 2019 as per the request of the treasury
on letter no. PED/1/CEB/2/11(i), had been charged to the income statement as interest expense.

According to LKAS 23 (Borrowing Cost) the borrowing cost of Rs. 3,556,442,931.30 incurred after commerciali-
zation of assets cannot be capitalized. Accordingly interest paid by the Treasury for the period of 2019 had been
charged to income statement. Hence there is no over statement of loss of the Board as per the accounting standard

The expenses incurred by the CEB on behalf of Employee Provident Fund maintains by the CEB amounting to
Rs.41,816,475 had been treated as expenses of the CEB without being treated as receivable.

According to the clause 20 (i) of the Provident Fund Rules published under the Ordinary Gazette Notification No.
1321/18 dated 31st December 2003, Expenses of managing and administering of the Provident Fund including
expenses directly attributable to the buying and selling of Investments shall be a charge on the funds of the Board,
unless otherwise decided by the Board from time to time.

Therefore inclusion of expenses pertaining to CEB Provident Fund, amounting to Rs. 41,421,524.00, into CEB’s
Financial Statements is in accordance with the aforesaid CEB Provident Fund Rules. Hence, it is not required CEB
to record Provident Fund expenses as receivables in the Financial Statements of CEB.

The jobs carried out by the CEB for supply, maintain and repair of power generators, lifts and air conditioners
of the government institutions prior to the year 2013 had been valued at cost and accounted them accordingly
instead of account based on their invoice values.

Prior to 2013 debtors were accounted on cash basis and actual cost of the job was shown as receivables from the
customer. Most of the receivables reflected in the financial statements prior to 2013 cannot be recovered. Those
unrecoverable balances consist of the receivables from Ministry of Power & Energy, receivables from hospitals and
jobs carried out by CEB based on the instructions received from Chairman, C.E.B.

It is not prudent to invoice the unrecoverable balance based on estimated value and pay the VAT that will cause
unnecessary loss to CEB. Therefore, the actual cost is shown as the amount to be recovered.

This issue has been informed several times to the auditors but same issue is repeating. Also CEB has made the
full provision for those unrecoverable receivables. Present deviation (as at 30th June 2020) with the actual cost an
estimated value prior to 2013 is Rs. 53,052,302.10.

Note: - the amount mentioned in the Auditor General report should be corrected as 53,052,302.10 instead of
Rs.66,978,761.

The amount of Rs.500 million out of Rs. 5 billion which was paid to the General treasury for the levy in the year
2016 had been amortized to the income statement by classifying as payment of management fee during the
year under review and prior year adjustment had been made for Rs. 1 billion.

As per the Department of Public Enterprises letter No.PDE/I/CEB/2/11/(iii) dated 2019-10-16ment this payment
was considered as “Management Fee” paid to treasury in the year 2019 and amortized over a period of 10 years
starting from year 2017.

It is noted that Treasury is providing and facilitating CEB for arrangements of finances to routine operation of CEB.

The CEB had not paid or made the provisions for the interest due to the General Treasury amounting to
Rs.2,495,574,443 as per the conditions in Sub-loan Agreements.

CEB has not been instructed or directed by the Department of Public Enterprise to make any provision for interest
on sub loan agreements. Hence CEB has not made any provisions in this regard.

The amount of Rs.4,200,000 named as dividend tax 10 per cent from treasury is remained as unidentified other
debtor in the books of headquarters. No provision had been made in the accounts for this amount.

The amount represents dividend tax 10% deducted by Lanka Transformers Ltd when paying gross dividend of
Rs.42, 000,000 for the year 2005/2006. This has been rectified in 2020.

The amount of Rs. 31,119,302 delay interest payable to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had been omitted from
the books of accounts

Action has been taken to record the delay interest in the Financial Statement for the year ended 31 December
2020.

The amount of Rs.734,574,801 valued jobs completed is remained in working progress account without being
transferred to the assets in the Distribution Division 1.

The above balance needs to be corrected as 1,448Mn since the balance in North Central Province is Rs. 714Mn
more than the amount shown in the Audit Query. However, 25% of the above long outstanding WIP balances have
already been transferred to PPE in the financial year 2020 and the actions are taken in Northern Province to transfer
the WIP balances to PPE in year 2020 based on the completion reports available. In general periodic review and
monitoring process is carried out by all the provinces on the WIP balance and transfer the completed jobs at the
time of completion.

The amount of Rs.128,264,040 payable for power purchase from Moragahakanda Power plant had been
omitted from the books of accounts.

The necessary actions have been taken to accrue all the outstanding invoices relevant to Moragahakanda Power
Plant in the books of accounts for the period ended 2020-07-31. Action will be taken to record all the invoices
promptly.

The amount of Rs. 944,030,864 of work in progress relating to the Upper Kothmale Hydro Power project which
has been commissioned in 2012 had not been transferred to the fixed assets.

This project was commissioned in year 2012 and initial asset transfer was executed in year 2014 to the respective
divisions. However, expenditures amounting to Rs. 944,030,864 have been accumulated in WIP account as at
31.12.2019 after the initial asset transfer. This amount comprised mainly with personnel expenses, legal fees for
arbitration & cost of land acquisition. Actions will be taken to transfer the balance cost to respective divisions within
the current year.

The amount of Rs. 603,573,159 of work in progress relating to the Puttalam Coal Power project which has been
commissioned in 2014 had not been transferred to the fixed assets.

This project was commissioned in year 2014 and initial asset transfer was executed in year 2015 to the respective
divisions. However, expenditures amounting to Rs. 603,573,159 have been accumulated in WIP account as at
31.12.2019 after the initial asset transfer. Actions will be taken to transfer the balance cost to respective divisions
within the current year.

A sum of Rs. 367,390,040 credit balance had been remained as inter divisions current account balance as at 31
December 2019 without being off setting with the inter division balances.

Out of the total balance Rs. 352Mn has been rectified during the financial year 2020.

Sum of Rs. 999.03 million disbursed during the year under review had not been recorded. Hence liability and
work in progress amount had been understated by same amount.

The above mentioned difference is related to Loan No 3146 and 3147. Loan No 3146 is utilized by several parts
of the project of Green Power Development Energy Efficiency Improvement Project Tranche -1. Major part of
the above unrecorded disbursements relates to the Moragolla Hydro Power Project. At the time preparing the
CEB financial statements the ERD statement was not updated with this disbursement and hence the financial
statements were unable to be updated with the above amount. Therefore, itis updated in the ledger for year 2020.

Un-reconciled Differences

(a)

(b)

A difference of Rs.764,717,080 was observed between the balance shown as payable to the Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation in the financial statements of the CEB as at 31 December 2019 and the corresponding balance
shown as receivable in the financial statements of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as at that date.

Action has been taken to reconcile and the record the unrecorded delayed interest charges in the financial
statements of 2020.

Un-reconciled differences aggregating Rs.31,813,455 was observed between the balances of bulk trade
debtors as at 31 December 2019 shown in the billing system of the Distribution Divisions 01, 02, 03 and 04 and
the corresponding amount shown in the financial statements of the year under review due to omission of some
balances in billing system and as well as in the financial statements. Further, an amount of Rs.423,764,624 is
remained as unidentified since 2012.

The process of recording billing transaction in the CEB billing system and the financial transactions record in the
General Ledger will not be agreed at any given date. Distribution Divisions carry out a reconciliation to determine
the reasons to such differences.

Heavy supply debtor's ledger balance includes active debtors, finalized debtors. However billing report extract
from IT branch, includes only active debtors balance. Therefore difference between billing report extract from IT
branch balance and the ledger balance is mainly due to finalized debtors.

Asum of Rs. 4,073,824,173 and Rs. 129,863,150 debit and credit balances respectively, had been remained in
the Collection Control ledger account, reconciliation and reasons of which had not been submitted to the audit.

These differences are arisen due to ordinary supply billing cycle cut-off date deviate from financial accounts cut-off
date. Therefore, the action has been initiated to make the ordinary supply billing cycle cut-off date to be same as
the financial year cut-off date.

Age analysis had not been submitted for 66 per cent of the total value of Rs.79,512,030 in relation to the
suspense balance and sum of Rs.70,306,494 remained over one year without being cleared

Continuous effort has been in placed to recognized unidentified customer payments to credit to respective
consumer accounts. Most of the balances appeared above are beyond the recognition by the CEB until complaints
are received from the consumers. This balance is under strict monitoring and preview.

Chairman

Ceylon Electricity Board

Report of the Auditor General on the Financial Statements of the Ceylon Electricity Board for the year ended 31 December
2019 in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.

Financial Statements
Qualified Opinion

The audit of the financial statements of the “Ceylon Electricity Board” (the CEB) for the year ended 31 December 2019
comprising the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019 and the statement of comprehensive income,
statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements,
including a summary of accounting policies, was carried out under my direction in pursuance of provisions in Article
154(1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka read in conjunction with provisions of the
National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018 and Finance Act No. 38 of 1971. My comments and observations which | consider
should be published with the annual report of the Board in terms of Section 12 of the National Audit Act, appear in this
report. My report to Parliament in pursuance of provisions in Article 154 (6) of the Constitution will be tabled in due
course.

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the basis for Qualified Opinion section of my report,
the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Board as at 31 December
2019, and ofits financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting
Standards.

Basis for Qualified Opinion
Compliance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLAS/SLFRS) and Accounting Policies.
(a) LKAS 1- Presentation of Financial Statements

(i) The Board had off set the balance of Rs.30,609,836 of sundry debtors against the creditors in relation to the
POS counter payment and Post office commission. As a result sundry debtors and creditors balance had been
understated by same amount.

(ii) Theloan disbursed amount ofRs.1,262,503,405 to Green Power Development and energy efficiency improvement
project had been shown as disbursement of Wind power project in the Note no.24.2.1.

(iii) Rs. 25 million paid as loan processing fee for Rs. 83 billion loans obtained had been presented as other expense
under administration expenses instead of presenting as finance cost.

(b) LKAS 2- Inventories and LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment

The CEB is applying the standard cost method for valuing of labour, material and overhead costs of its capital and
maintenance jobs, instead of applying the actual costs as per the provisions in the above Standards. As a result,
the favourable material price variance and labour and overhead rate variances aggregating to Rs. 6,409,494,526
and unfavourable stores price variance of Rs.2,428,128,229 arisen thereon had been brought to the financial
statements.

As a result of that, the operating results, assets, liabilities and equity of the CEB have been significantly affected
due to high financial involvement in relation to the capital jobs. However, the impact to the financial statements
thereon could not be ascertained in audit due to non-availability of required information relating to those capital
jobs.

LKAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

The useful lifetime of fully depreciated non-current assets which are being continuously utilized by the CEB had
not been reviewed as mentioned in the accounting policies. For instance, fully depreciated four power stations and
1,683 numbers motor vehicles costing Rs.32,241,176,427 and Rs. 3,918,235,311 respectively are being still using
without estimating the real life time.

LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment

The fixed assets amounting to Rs.172,019,335,924 in the Transmission Division had not been physically verified
during the year under review.

LKAS 27- Provisions, Contingency Liabilities and Contingency Assets

Recoverability of Rs.2,312,756,993 invested in financial instruments by Employee Provident Fund (EPF) of the
Board is doubtful due to non-existence of those financial instruments. The CEB is the custodian trustee of the
Employee Provident Fund and therefore, ultimate responsibility for contingencies (if any) is remained with the
Board. However, no any provision or disclosure had been made in the financial statements of the Board regarding
this contingent liability.

Accounting Deficiencies

(a)

(b)

A debit balance of Rs.3,535,799,151 (stock shortage) and a credit balance of Rs.90,343,073 (stock excess) had
remained in the Stock Adjustment Account for more than one year without being cleared.

As per the decision No. 10/2 434/423/034 of the Cabinet of Ministers, the CEB should repay the loan and interest
thereon to the General Treasury for the loan amount of Rs.159,184,187,965 obtained for the construction of
Lakwijaya Power Plant. However, the CEB had not paid or made provisions in its accounts for the above payments
although the Department of External Resources of the General Treasury had paid an amount of Rs. 25,247,801,891
up to 31 December 2018 as interest for the said loan to the lending bank.

As a result of non-provision of interest, retained earnings as at 31 December 2019 had been understated by Rs.
25,247,801,891.

The amount of Rs.3,556,442,931 recorded to the equity on 17 October 2019 as per the request of the treasury
on letter no. PED/1/CEB/2/11(i), had been charged to the income statement as interest expense during the year
under review. Further, this amount had not been incurred by the CEB. As a result of that, loss of the board had been
overstated by that amount.

The expenses incurred by the CEB on behalf of Employee Provident Fund maintain by the CEB amounting to
Rs.41,816,475 had been treated as expenses of the CEB without being reimbursed and as such, the loss for the
year under review had been overstated by similar amount.

The jobs carried out by the CEB for supply, maintain and repair of power generators, lifts and air conditioners of the
government institutions prior to the year 2013 had been valued at cost and accounted them accordingly instead
of account the jobs based on their invoice values. As a result, the receivables and retained earnings shown in the
financial statements had been understated by Rs.66,987,761.

The amount of Rs.500 million out of Rs. 5 billion which was paid to the General treasury as levy in the year 2016
had been amortised to the income statement by classifying as payment of management fee during the year
under review and prior year adjustment had been made for Rs. 1 billion. The balance amount of Rs.3.5 billion is
shown as other debtors in the financial statement instead of being charged to the equity statement. However, no
management services had been obtained by the CEB from the General treasury. Therefore loss for the year had
been overstated by Rs.500 million.

from the books of accounts during the year under review. Hence loss for the year had been understated by same
amount.

The amount of Rs. 944,030,864 of work in progress relating to the Upper Kothmale Hydro Power project which was
completed in 2012 had not been transferred to the fixed assets. Hence depreciation for the year under review and

The amount of Rs. 603,573,159 of work in progress relating to the Puttalam Coal Power project which was

(©)

(d)

A difference of Rs.764,717,080 was observed between the balance shown as payable to the Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation in the financial statements of the CEB as at 31 December 2019 and the corresponding balance shown
as receivable in the financial statements of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as at that date.

The Chairman of the CEB states in this regard as follows.

“As per the decision taken at the meeting chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury on 30 September 2013, it
was decided to pay interest on overdue invoice value (beyond the credit period) with effect from 20 April 2013.
However, the delayed interest payment of Rs. 753, 610,829 was relevant to fuel purchase before 20 April 2013 by
the CEB. Therefore, it is not required to carry out reconciliation for this difference since the CEB does not liable.”

However, this dispute had not been cleared even as at 31 December 2019 though it has been reiterated in audit
reports since 2013 continuously.

Un-reconciled differences aggregating to Rs. 31,813,455 was observed between the balances of bulk trade
debtors as at 31 December 2019 shown in the billing system of the Distribution Divisions 01, 02, 03 and 04 and
the corresponding amount shown in the financial statements for the year under review due to omission of some
balances in billing system and as well as in the financial statements. Further, an amount of Rs.423,764,624 is
remained as unidentified since 2012.

Reconciliation for the balance of Rs. 4,073,824,173 and Rs. 129,863,150 available in the Collection Control ledger
account as debit and credit as at 31 December 2019 had not been done as per the instruction letter issued by the
AFM(DD1) on 26 July 2005 and reasons for such balances had not been submitted to the audit. Hence accuracy of
the balance available in Collection control account was unable to verify.

Age analysis had not been submitted for 66 per cent of the total value of Rs.79,512,030 in relation to the suspense
balance and sum of Rs.70,306,494 remained over one year without being cleared.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Board's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless management either intend to liquidate the Board or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do
SO.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Board's financial reporting process.

As per Section 16(1) of the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018, the Board is required to maintain proper books and
records of all its income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, to enable annual and periodic financial statements to be
prepared of the Board.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Sri Lanka
Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, | exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. | also:

® Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

® Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Board's internal control.

® Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the management.

® Conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Board's ability to continue as a going concern. If | conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, | am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Board to cease
to continue as a going concern.

® Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.

| communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, significant audit findings,
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that | identify during my audit.

illegal as per the court decision given under case no.CA/WRIT/193/2015.

Various staff allowances had been paid from time to time to the staff of the CEB on the approval of the Board
in contrary to the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers on 14 November 2007 and the provisions in the

employees. However, the CEB had paid the PAYE tax of Rs.4,919,156,644 from its owned fund without deducting
it from the salaries of the respective employees during the period from 2010 to 2019 in contravening to the above
decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers and circular no. 3/2016 issued by the public enterprise Department.
The amount so paid during the year under review was Rs.709,110,273.

The value of non-cash benefits specified by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in the Gazette Notification
No.1706/18 dated 20 May 2001 should be considered when calculating the PAYE tax of each employee. However,
the CEB had not taken into account the non-cash benefits such as provision of quarters, apartments and motor
vehicles for private use etc. for this purpose.

Instead of granting vehicle loans at the rate of interest ranging 10 per cent to 14 per cent as per the Public
Enterprises Circular No 130 of 08 March 1998, the CEB had granted these loans at an interest rate of 4.2 per cent.
Further, it was observed that the staff loans have been paid without any control even though the CEB faces severe
liquidity problems.

recovered for more than five years. Out of thatan amount Rs. 142,477,285 is to be recovered from the government
institutions and CEB had not taken necessary action to recover at the initial stage of the transactions.

The amount of Rs.3,371,599,434 is remained as Trade creditors of Transmission Division without being settling
more than one year.

Even though a amount of 4,952.85 MT valued at Rs. 95,211,376 has been identified as deficit of the coal stock as
at 05 October 2019, a physical verification had not been carried out by the Board of survey team. However the
amount of 28,006.66 MT valued at Rs.456,197,162 had been adjusted to income statement as surplus of coal stock
as at 31 December 2019. Hence it was unable to verify the accuracy of the coal stock balance available as at 31
December 2019.

Even though the CEB had sold electricity to LECO and purchasing fuel from Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for
several years, there were no sales and purchase agreements entered with those two parties in order to ensure the
smooth operations between these two Institutions.

Asum ofRs.134,447,792 had been deducted by the lending agency in 2019 as commitment charges from the loans
given for implementing the foreign funded projects of the CEB due to un-utilization of the funds in timely manner.
However, the accuracy of the commitment charges cannot be verified due to non-availability of calculations.

According to the Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018 - 2037, new generation of 657 MW which consists of
370 MW from thermal and 287 MW from renewable energy should be added to the national system. However, only
222 MW thermal power which were notin the planand 25.25 MW renewable energy had been added to the system
during the year under review. As a result of that, quantity of 735 Ghw valued at Rs.22.2 billion had been purchased
as emergency power during the year under review.

A special investigation had been carried out by the Internal Audit Branch in respect of stock shortage of
Rs.39,551,696 identified in 2014 under project of Uthuruwasanthaya in April 2017. However, no disciplinary
action had been taken against the officer who is responsible for the shortage amount of Rs.2,510,056 out of total
shortage of Rs.39,551,696 even up to the date of this report. Further, a court case (Case no B/1164/15) had been
filed against other officer in Magestrict Court, Trincomalee by the Criminal Investigation Department in 2015 in
this regard. Further, information relating to present position of the court case was not made available for audit.

The prompt actions had not been taken by the Board up to 16 August 2018 against the person who was liable for
stock shortages of Rs.3,674,861 which had been occurred during the period of 20 November 2006 to 20 February
2012, in Asset Management Division (Power Plant) even the formal investigation was completed. Further, the same
employee had committed a fraud in another office of the CEB and his duty has been terminated after recovering
only Rs.99, 155 as the value of the fraud prior to the aforesaid fraud.

An officer who is liable for the stock shortage of Rs.3,789,893 had been allowed to retire on 15 October 2011
without being recovered the loss as recommended by the committee appointed for investigation. Further, the
above material amount had remained in the books of account without being taken any remedial action. The board
is in the process to write off this amount without taking actions against the officers who is allowed to retire the
defaulter.

The oversight entry has been rectified in 2020.

(ii) The amount of Rs.1,262,503,405 loan disbursed to Green Power Development and energy efficiency

The oversight entry has been rectified in 2020.

(iii) The amount of Rs. 25 million paid for loan processing fee for Rs. 83 billion loans obtained had been
presented as other expense under administration expenses category instead of presenting as finance cost.

The rectification of expenses categorization has been affected.
LKAS 2-Inventories and LKAS 16 -Property, Plant and Equipment
The CEB is applying the standard cost method for valuing of labour, material and overhead costs.

As per LKSA 2 paragraph 21 standard cost method for the measurement of inventories are recommended.
Accordingly, CEB uses standard prices for valuing of stocks, WIP and Property plant and Equipment due to the
practical difficulty of using actual costs. The committee formed to determine the standard prices of inventory work
hard on to ascertain precise and reasonable estimation that very close to actual prices of the inventory. However
due to complexity of technicality and huge volume of inventory, there is a gap between actual and standard prices.
This matter would be resolved once the integrated accounting system is introduced.

CEB has initiated the following actions to minimize gap between standard prices and actual prices.

® labour rate variance of DD4 and DD 3 has been eliminated from financial accounts of year 2019. Other two
divisions will be able to do the same in year 2020.

® With the adaptation of the weighted average method for inventory valuation as recommended by the
committee which is appointed for, will be able to eliminate the impact of the material price variances to the
Financial Statements. Since this is being addressed in the ongoing ERP system, this issue will be solved once
the ERP system is in place.

® Other than the Distribution assets which are transferred from WIP all other Property plant and Equipment
(Land, Building, Motor Vehicle, Machinery, and Office Equipment) are valued at actual cost which complies
with the recommendations of LKASs.

LKAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

(i) Fully depreciated 1,683 numbers motor vehicles costing Rs. 3,918,235,311

The data has been collected from the Divisions regarding the useful life of the motor vehicles and the analysis
is in progress. A revised useful life could be recommended to record in the financial statements for year 2020

(ii) Fully depreciated four power stations Rs.32,241,176,427

The Generation Division power plants are unique and complex in nature. The economic life span of the
generators derived based on the Original Manufacturer's recommendation. A Committee will be appointed
to revisit the economic life span of the power plants. As CEB has well maintained the power plants and
Generators are operated beyond the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)’s expected life span.

LKAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment
The fixed assets amounting to Rs.172,019,335,924 in the Transmission Division had not been physically verified.

Relevantinstructions have been issued to conduct an Annual Physical Verification with regard physical existence of
Fixed Assets of Transmission Division.

LKAS 27- Provisions, Contingency Liabilities and Contingency Assets

Recoverability of Rs.2, 312,756,993 invested in financial instruments by Employee Provident Fund (EPF) of the
Board is doubtful due to non-existence of those financial instruments.

As per the Paragraph 3.10 of the Conceptual Framework for Reporting Entity, A reporting entity is an entity that
is required, or chooses, to prepare financial statements. Accordingly, the CEB Provident Fund is a separate entity
managed through Rules of Provident Fund (Gazette no.1321/18- 2003-12-31). Provident Fund Rules required the
Fund to prepare separate Financial Statement.

Further, as per the clause 21(ii) of the Provident Fund rules “as at end of each financial year of the Board the
Committee shall make up the accounts of the Fund and furnish the same to the Board. In so making up the accounts
of the Fund, the Committee with the advice of the Auditors of the Fund may create such reserves and make such
provisions as the may think advisable”.

Therefore ultimate responsibility for contingencies (if any) is remained with the Fund. Accordingly, required
disclosures had been made in the financial statements of the Fund regarding this contingency.

1.2.2 Accounting Deficiencies

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

A debit balance of Rs.3,535,799,151 (stock shortage) and a credit balance of Rs.90,343,073 (stock excess) had
remained in the Stock Adjustment Account for more than one year.

Actions have been taken by the respective divisions to pass necessary book entries where possible in 2020 and the
rest of shortage balances would be cleared upon completion of legal action.

AsperthedecisionNo. 10/2434/423/034 ofthe Cabinet of Ministers, the CEB should repay the loan and interest
thereon to the General Treasury for the loan amount of Rs.159,184,187,965 obtained for the construction of
Lakwijaya Power Plant.

The repayment up to year 2018 had been absorbed by the General Treasury by considering materiality of liquidity
position of CEB. However as per the direction by Director General Public Enterprises Department, payment of the
interest amounting Rs. 3,556,442,931.30 made by the Treasury for the period of 2019 had been adjusted in the
books of CEB. Further, noted that adjustments will have to be made from year 2020 onwards subject to direction
from Public Enterprise Department.

The amount of Rs.3,556,442,931 received for the amount transferred to the equity by the treasury had been
charged to the income statement as interest expense.

According to LKAS 23 (Borrowing Cost) the borrowing cost of Rs. 3,556,442,931.30 incurred after
commercialization of assets cannot be capitalized. Accordingly interest paid by the Treasury for the period of 2019
had been charged to income statement. Hence there is no over statement of loss of the Board as per the accounting
standard.

The expenses incurred by the CEB on behalf of Employee Provident Fund maintains by the CEB amounting to
Rs.41,816,475 had been treated as expenses of the CEB without being treated as receivable.

According to the clause 20 (i) of the Provident Fund Rules published under the Ordinary Gazette Notification No.
1321/18 dated 31st December 2003, Expenses of managing and administering of the Provident Fund including
expenses directly attributable to the buying and selling of Investments shall be a charge on the funds of the Board,
unless otherwise decided by the Board from time to time.

Therefore inclusion of expenses pertaining to CEB Provident Fund, amounting to Rs. 41,421,524.00, into CEB’s
Financial Statements is in accordance with the aforesaid CEB Provident Fund Rules. Hence, it is not required CEB
to record Provident Fund expenses as receivables in the Financial Statements of CEB.

The jobs carried out by the CEB for supply, maintain and repair of power generators, lifts and air conditioners
of the government institutions prior to the year 2013 had been valued at cost and accounted them accordingly
instead of account based on their invoice values.

Prior to 2013 debtors were accounted on cash basis and actual cost of the job was shown as receivables from the
customer. Most of the receivables reflected in the financial statements prior to 2013 cannot be recovered. Those
unrecoverable balances consist of the receivables from Ministry of Power & Energy, receivables from hospitals and
jobs carried out by CEB based on the instructions received from Chairman, C.E.B.

It is not prudent to invoice the unrecoverable balance based on estimated value and pay the VAT that will cause
unnecessary loss to CEB. Therefore, the actual cost is shown as the amount to be recovered.

This issue has been informed several times to the auditors but same issue is repeating. Also CEB has made the full
provision for those unrecoverable receivables. Present deviation (as at 30th June 2020) with the actual cost and
estimated value prior to 2013 is Rs. 53,052,302.10.

Note: - the amount mentioned in the Auditor General report should be corrected as 53,052,302.10 instead of
Rs.66,978,761.

The amount of Rs.500 million out of Rs. 5 billion which was paid to the General treasury for the levy in the year
2016 had been amortised to the income statement by classifying as payment of management fee during the
year under review and prior year adjustment had been made for Rs. 1 billion.

As per the Department of Public Enterprises letter No.PDE/I/CEB/2/11/(iii) dated 2019-10-16 this payment was
considered as “Management Fee” paid to treasury in the year 2019 and amortised over a period of 10 years starting
from year 2017.

It is noted that Treasury is providing and facilitating CEB for arrangements of finances to routine operation of CEB.

The CEB had not paid or made the provisions for the interest due to the General Treasury amounting to
Rs.2,495,574,443 as per the conditions in Sub-loan Agreements.

CEB has not been instructed or directed by the Department of Public Enterprise to make any provision for interest
on sub loan agreements. Hence CEB has not made any provisions in this regard.

The amount of Rs.4,200,000 named as dividend tax 10 per cent from treasury is remained as unidentified other
debtor in the books of headquarters. No provision had been made in the accounts for this amount.

The amount represents dividend tax 10% deducted by Lanka Transformers Ltd when paying gross dividend of
Rs.42, 000,000 for the year 2005/2006. This has been rectified in 2020.

The amount of Rs. 31,119,302 delay interest payable to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had been omitted from
the books of accounts

Action has been taken to record the delay interest in the Financial Statement for the year ended 31 December 2020

The amount of Rs.734,574,801 valued jobs completed is remained in working progress account without being
transferred to the assets in the Distribution Division 1.

The above balance needs to be corrected as 1,448Mn since the balance in North Central Province is Rs. 714Mn
more than the amount shown in the Audit Query. However, 25% of the above long outstanding WIP balances have
already been transferred to PPE in the financial year 2020 and the actions are taken in Northern Province to transfer
the WIP balances to PPE in year 2020 based on the completion reports available. In general periodic review and
monitoring process is carried out by all the provinces on the WIP balance and transfer the completed jobs at the
time of completion.

The amount of Rs.128,264,040 payable for power purchase from Moragahakanda Power plant had been
omitted from the books of accounts.

The necessary actions have been taken to accrue all the outstanding invoices relevant to Moragahakanda Power
Plant in the books of accounts for the period ended 2020-07-31. Action will be taken to record all the invoices
promptly.

The amount of Rs. 944,030,864 of work in progress relating to the Upper Kothmale Hydro Power project which
has been commissioned in 2012 had not been transferred to the fixed assets.

This project was commissioned in year 2012 and initial asset transfer was executed in year 2014 to the respective
divisions. However, expenditures amounting to Rs. 944,030,864 have been accumulated in WIP account as at
31.12.2019 after the initial asset transfer. This amount comprised mainly with personnel expenses, legal fees for
arbitration & cost of land acquisition. Actions will be taken to transfer the balance cost to respective divisions within
the current year.

The amount of Rs. 603,573,159 of work in progress relating to the Puttalam Coal Power project which has been
commissioned in 2014 had not been transferred to the fixed assets.

This project was commissioned in year 2014 and initial asset transfer was executed in year 2015 to the respective
divisions. However, expenditures amounting to Rs. 603,573,159 have been accumulated in WIP account as at
31.12.2019 after the initial asset transfer. Actions will be taken to transfer the balance cost to respective divisions
within the current year.

A sum of Rs. 367,390,040 credit balance had been remained as inter divisions current account balance as at 31
December 2019 without being off setting with the inter division balances.

This has been rectified in current finical year

Un-reconciled Differences

(d)

A difference of Rs.764,717,080 was observed between the balance shown as payable to the Ceylon Petroleum
Corporation in the financial statements of the CEB as at 31 December 2019 and the corresponding balance
shown as receivable in the financial statements of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as at that date.

Action has been taken to reconcile and the record the unrecorded delayed interest charges in the financial
statements of 2020.

Un-reconciled differences aggregating Rs.31,813,455 was observed between the balances of bulk trade
debtors as at 31 December 2019 shown in the billing system of the Distribution Divisions 01, 02, 03 and 04 and
the corresponding amount shown in the financial statements of the year under review due to omission of some
balances in billing system and as well as in the financial statements. Further, an amount of Rs.423,764,624 is
remained as unidentified since 2012.

The process of recording billing transaction in the CEB billing system and the financial transactions record in the
General Ledger will not be agreed at any given date. Distribution Divisions carry out a reconciliation to determine
the reasons to such differences.

Heavy supply debtor's ledger balance includes active debtors, finalized debtors. However billing report extract
from IT branch, includes only active debtors balance. Therefore difference between billing report extract from IT
branch balance and the ledger balance is mainly due to finalized debtors. However the statement of reconciliation
of debtors given in the financial statement.

Asum of Rs. 4,073,824,173 and Rs. 129,863,150 debit and credit balances respectively, had been remained in
the Collection Control ledger account, reconciliation and reasons of which had not been submitted to the audit.

These differences are arisen due to ordinary supply billing cycle cut-off date deviate from financial accounts cut-off
date. Therefore, the action has been initiated to make the ordinary supply billing cycle cut-off date deviate same as
the financial year cut-off date.

AsumofRs.79,512,030 had been remained in the suspense ledger account according to the financial statement
submitted. Age analysis not been submitted for 66 per cent of the total value of the suspense balance and sum
of Rs.70,306,494 remained over one year without being cleared

Continuous effort has been in placed to recognized unidentified customer payments to credit to respective
consumer accounts. Most of the balances appeared above are beyond the recognition by the CEB until complaints
are received from the consumers. This balance is under strict monitoring and preview.

Functions performed by the board out of its powers, functions and duties

The Board is continuing its salary payment on circular no.2014/GM/46/Pers dated 27 November 2014 which
was illegal as per the court decision given under case no.CA/WRIT/193/2015.

The Hon. Attorney General has given an opinion on how to comply with the court order. CEB is following the
opinion given by the Hon. Attorney General.

Various staff allowances had been paid from time to time to the staff of the CEB on the approval of the Board
in contrary to the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers on 14 November 2007 and the provisions in the
Management Services Circular No. 39 of 26 May 2009.

According the Ceylon Electricity Board Act No. 17 of 1969, under the clause 12 powers of the Board are listed.
Clause 12 (m): to make rules in respect of the administration of the affairs of the Board

Clause 12(n): to do all other things which, in the opinion of the Board are necessary to facilitate the proper carrying
on of its Business

Accordingly, mentioned findings are related to the benefits given by the Board to its employees to uplift their
morale towards working for the betterment of the organization. Further, the act itself provides the authority for the
Board to make rules in respect of administration of the Board affairs.

The Cabinet of Ministers has taken decisions on 13 December 2007 at the time of salary revision and on 20 May
2015 at the time of consideration of Collective Agreement, to shift the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax liability to
employees.

The PAYE Tax liability of CEB employees has been borne by the CEB since its employees were made liable for PAYE
Tax. Thiswas informed to the Ministry of P & RE and Salaries and Cadre Commission on several times and discussions
were also held with Trade Unions. However, no consensus was reached regarding reverting it back to employees.
The Collective Agreement signed on 04.01.2018 has been published by the Extra Ordinary Gazette No. 2068/5
dated 23.04.2018. It appears now a violation of the collective agreement to change the agreed remuneration and
would create further legal repercussions

The value of non-cash benefits specified by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in the Gazette
Notification No.1706/18 dated 20 May 2001 should be considered when calculating the PAYE tax of each
employee.

The instructions was issued through 2018/GM/39/FM, Accounts Circular No 526 to take the non-cash benefits
such as quarters, apartments and motor vehicle for private use etc. for the PAYE calculation. Since the instruction
was issued with the implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act in 2018, it will take reasonable period to comply
with this by all the Divisions of the CEB.

Instead of granting vehicle loans at the rate of interest ranging 10 per cent to 14 per cent as per the Public
Enterprises Circular No 130 of 08 March 1998, the CEB had granted these loans at an interest rate of 4.2 per
cent.

According the Ceylon Electricity Board Act No. 17 of 1969, under the clause 12 powers of the Board are listed.
Clause 12 (m): to make rules in respect of the administration of the affairs of the Board

Clause 12(n): to do all other things which, in the opinion of the Board are necessary to facilitate the proper carrying
on of its Business

Accordingly, mentioned findings are related to the benefits given by the Board to its employees to uplift their
morale towards working for the betterment of the organization. Further, the act itself provides the authority for the
Board to make rules in respect of administration of the Board affairs.

1 90      CEYLON ELECTRICITY BOARD | Annual Report 2019

Replies to the Report of the Auditor General (Contd.)

® Non-compliances with written laws or other general or special directions issued by the governing body of
the Company.

(a) Section 28(3) of Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No.20 of 2009
The CEB had not paid interest for consumer deposits as specified in the act

1. As per Clause No. 3(d) and No 30 of SL Electricity Act No.20 of 2009 the Electricity Tariff shall be set by
PUCSL. However the prevailing electricity tariff is not generating sufficient cash to run the business of
CEB. The relevant clauses in the Act. is as follows;

“3. (1) the functions of the Commission shall be to act as the economic, technical and safety regulator
for the electricity industry in Sri Lanka, and-

(d) to regulate tariffs and other charges levied by licensees and other electricity undertakings, in
orderto ensure that the mosteconomical and efficient service possible is provided to consumers; ”

“30. (1) This section shall apply to-

(a) Tariffs or charges levied by the transmission licensee for the transmission and bulk sale of
electricity (hereinafter referred to as “transmission and bulk sale tariffs”); and

(b) Tariffs or charges levied by the distribution licensee for the distribution and supply of electricity
(herein after referred to as “distribution and supply tariffs”).

(2) Transmission and bulk sale tariffs and distribution and supply tariffs, as the case may be, shall, in
accordance with conditions specified in the relevant licence -

(a) beset by the relevant licensee in accordance with a cost reflective methodology approved by the
Commission;

(b) permit the relevant licensee to recover all reasonable costs incurred in the carrying out of the
activities authorized by its licence on an efficient basis,

(c) be approved by the Commission in accordance with the policy guideline approved by the
Cabinet of Ministers under section 5; and

(d) be published in such manner as may be required by the Commission, in order to ensure public
knowledge.”

2. As per Clause No 28(3) of SL Electricity Act No.20 of 2009 each Distribution License (DL) has to pay the
interest for securities deposit to its customers. The relevant clause in the Act. is as follows;

Clause 28(3) “Where any sum of money is provided to a distribution licensee by a way of security in
pursuance of this section, the licensee shall pay interest on such sum of money at such rate as may
from time to time be fixed by the licensee with the approval of the commission, for the period in which
it remains in the hands of the licensee.”

3. Presently CEB is not receiving sufficient cash collection to run its business and as a result CEB is using
the security deposit of its customers as a part of its working capital and balance working capital is
obtained from bank overdrafts, short term loans etc.

4. The benefits obtained by utilization of security deposit of its customers as its working capital by CEB
i.e. saving in interest on bank overdraft is distributed among all its customers by way of reduced
tariff. In other wards CEB has distributed more than Rs. 1,592 million among all its customers for the
year 2019 which is the estimated value given in draft audit report based on if the security deposit is
deposited in a bank and the interest that would have been earned.

5. If as per this clause if DLs going to pay the interest on security deposit it will be an added financial
burden for DLs and additional cost to the industry.

6. Hence we have recommended the complete deletion of clause No 28(3) from SL Electricity Act No.20
of 2009 to ministry and requested ministry to take further action on this regard.

(c) Ceylon Electricity Board Act, No. 17 of 1969, Section 46 and Section 11(a) and (b) of Part Il of the Finance Act,
No. 38 of 1971

“The CEB had invested only Rs.8,996 million as at 31 December 2019 in the Insurance Escrow Fund although
it was stated that a contribution of 0.1 per cent of the total value of the gross fixed assets as at the end of each
year”

This difference has arisen mainly due to non-investment in Insurance Investment Escrow Account due to CEB is
experiencing adverse cash flow situation from many years. However, action will be taken to investment equal of
0.1% of the gross fixed assets in insurance reserve investment account once the CEB Liquidity position and cash
flows are improved.

(d) Section 9.4 of PED 12 Circular issued by Department of Public Enterprise

Since the CEB is not in a position to withhold the requests made by the line ministry to release its employees, the
expenses incurred cannot be controlled by the CEB

3 Other Audit Issues

years, there were no sales and purchase agreements entered with those two parties in order to ensure the
smooth operations between these two Institutions.

Steps have been taken to prepare power sales agreement between CEB and LECO with participation of high
ranking officers of both parties with Legal clearance. However, it was not able to enter in to an agreement with the
parties concerned so far. LECO has requested some actions from PUCSL by the letter issued on 24th July 2018 in
this regard.

CEB higher management has been appointed a committee to study and formulate Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA)
between CEB and CPC. Accordingly, several discussions have been held between CEB and CPC to finalize FSA.
Finally drafted FSA has been submitted for the attention of Chairman- CEB through GM - CEB

A sum of Rs.134,447,792 had been deducted by the lending agency in 2019 as commitment charges from the
loans given for implementing the foreign funded projects of the CEB.

Commitment charge is common to all projects and it cannot be avoided even the project is on schedule due to
stringent loan covenants in the loan agreements.

According to the Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018 - 2037, new generation of 657 MW should be
added by thermal and renewable energy of 370 MW and 287 MW respectively.

Due to under mentioned reasons proposed Power Plants have been delayed.
